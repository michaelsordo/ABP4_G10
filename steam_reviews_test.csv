424893,2018-02-28,0,0,168,False,Recommended,The game would be solid if some of the buggy mechanics were fixed and some new added content that benefitted which part of the ecosystem you are thriving in. Overall I would give this game a 7.5/10,Rust

424899,2016-11-23,0,0,768,True,Recommended,Very Fun Game. I have meet a lot of people whom I would call close friends and I have learned about the game as it has been updated. Yes I sometimes rage at the game for being killed after i respawn as a naked but in the end I enjoy playing the game and the getting the loot. This game has never let me down.,Rust

424901,2016-04-04,0,0,124,True,Recommended,"Rust is a great game to get into if you have a group of people to play with. It has a bit of a steep learning curve if you don't have friends that already play. This gets even worse depending on what server you decide to play on. Servers can be modded to have nice features and if someone isn't there to explain them you wouldn't know! While so far this might sound kind of ""meh"" it really isn't. Willing that you have a posse it's actually quite fun! You can get into staged fights with different weapons leave creative and probably lewd drawings for them and even blow up all of their hard work.",Rust
424902,2016-04-05,0,0,185,True,Recommended,I have never played a game that has had me so invested into protecting items which are merely pixels on a screen. I must warn you that you will probably spend hours upon hours grinding for resources to simply die from a wolf or a non friendly player. Not forgetting constructing your base to find you were raided and killed when you logged in next. That being said the pure adrenaline when taking part in a raid and exchanging gun fire will keep you hooked! Would recommend to anybody!,Rust

424931,2018-01-13,0,0,123,True,Recommended,I understand that i am yet t log a massive amount of hours. However in the relatively small amount of time i have played i can safely list a few things i noticed.pros difficult but rewarding grind that allows new items just often enough to hold intrest. The unpredictability of the game also means that you can go from 0 100 rather quickly if you end the right player. weapon system that rewards skill and practice relatively vertical recoil for most guns. the social aspect of the game allows for some of the most memorable and EVERYONE has a mic from the 700 deceble screaming inbred autistic twelvies to literaly the chillest human being i have ever met to cheeki breeki crazed slavs who squat in a cave they call a house and throw axes at each other all day. solid buillding system good way at balancing teirs cons upkeep system is a bit of a joke that is only there to mop up servers literal morons zergs are real on high pop servers Travis,Rust
424932,2018-06-18,0,0,304,False,Not Recommended,I have mixed reviews on Rust. It can be alot of fun with friends but not for a long time and having too many people with you can be a cluster . Let's get started1. LootingLooting in Rust isn't really a main part of the game yes there is looting but that doesn't happen much at the beginning of your life. The game is more about resource gathering and crafting. You spawn into the world completely naked bearing only a rock and torch. You can use your rock to hit trees nodes and barrels. You collect cloth and start to craft your first clothes and weapon/tool. However that's where it isn't fun with friends. You could spend a whole hour just trying to meet up with 1 buddy because of dying from the following reasons Starvation Dehydation Drowning Freezing Heating up and then proceeding to die of thirst Another player A wolf A bear A chicken A scientist and even Cacti! After finally meeting up with your friend survival begins.2. SurvivalSurvival in Rust can either be fun and moderately difficult or it can be a waste of time and insanely difficult to meet up with friends/ make a base. Going back to how you can die servers can have up to 500 players (give or take). This means that you have a good chance of crossing paths with another survivor. Now in other survival games you're chances of them being friendly is about a 50/50 (again give or take) however in Rust there is a 90% that they won't say a word to you and they will instantly attack you sending you back to square 1. This brings me to...3. Community ...Community! Oh boy the community in Rust is dare I say CANCEROUS. This game started as a decently friendly community you probably did have a 50/50 chance of making a friend. However just like a cancer cell the toxicity of this game spreaded like wildfire and today you have a good chance of someone running at you with a sword playing/making obnoxious sounds through their mic. Now if this sounds like your cup of tea you'll fit right in However it gets old quick and after dying constantly and spawing in naked again you'll end up giving up. I don't see a future where the community of Rust becomes friendly ever again.4. ShootingShooting in Rust is good. There is Spray Patterns Recoil Bullet Drop and Travel Time. But you probably won't get to the point of having guns unless you're an absolute professional time waster and you farm for it. That's all I have to say about shooting5. Closing UpNow Rust is not a bad game it gets frequent updates and I don't expect the game to be abandoned. The updates definitley add some good mechanics but it doesn't change the things I dislike about the game. Anyway you can make you're own decision about the game but that's just my thoughts.,Rust
424933,2018-06-18,0,0,217,False,Recommended,Best devs ever. Awesome game a lot of updatesP.S. Don't trust no one !,Rust

424936,2015-02-09,0,0,50,True,Not Recommended,"Legacy Rust was and will always be the true version that was ""Rust"". This *new* thing they call ""Rust"" is not what the fans fell in love with. Oh sure you can switch to Legacy Rust but there's no support for it updates bug fixes anti cheats etc. It's now dominated by Russians and hackers. There aren't any fully functional/ populated English speaking servers to be able to play on the Legacy Rust even if they could solve the hacking problem. The original Rust (that was highly acclaimed) is no longer available and has been replaced with a completely different game. New Rust has completely different game mechanics graphics game play less features etc. It's a horrible flop that promises to be like the original version but it will never be the same game that got all those positive reviews and hours from us gamers. Buy it? What will you even do in game? At this point in time H1Z1 (a brand new clone of Rust) is much more exciting to play and H1Z1 itself is terribly boring. Stay away unless Rust becomes free to play! (WARNING Micro transactions are a planned feature for Rust)",Rust

424939,2015-02-09,0,0,13,True,Recommended,I have waited for a long time to write this review why? because I didnt think it would be fair to judge a game that is in alpha. It was a rough start. The first couple builds where remarkably dull. I would get on play for a half an hour get my head bashed in by a rock and proceed to spam ALT F4. The game has since then become an uncut gem in my opinon. The UI is amazing and simple to well use and the bugs have for the most part went away. I only have three issues with this game. One grass is all over the goddamn place and the only way to turn it down is through the console (it's not a performance issue I just prefer less grass). Two lag is always present when it comes to PVP which is more than essential to fix in an online only game. And three I find it very hard to find wildlife I dont know if they just dont spawn or what but I might as well be looking for a tumbleweed to eat. To give my final opinion if Facepunch can cut this gem they're looking at my Game of the Year(s).,Rust

BEARS OMG STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM BEARS.100% best survival game on steam at this current time and it is so active with updates!! and so polished!!,Rust
424949,2018-08-03,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,At first I got excited for Rust for it seemed it might be a more grown up verison of Minecraft with its harvest/research sandbox mechanics. I suppose it's my own fault for not taking the survival part seriously. Any attempts to avoid the kill or be killed mentality will bring you nothing but frustration. As mentioned by a number of other reviewers solo play is nigh impossible. I bounced from server to server trying to find a quiet corner to amass even the most basic of supplies to no avail. I found servers to run rampant with players decked out with superior equipment trolling on the coastlines where the noobs begin their journey. Were there a way to keep the PVP aspect a little more fair I maybe would have invested more time into the game.I think it's important to mention Rust has the most toxic gaming environments I've ever encountered. Players flame up at the drop of a hat chat is plagued with complainers swearing racial slurs you name it. Heaven forbid you ask a question to the community to help you find your way else you'll be made fun of for the next ten minutes. If you need an outlet for your poor sadistic soul you'll find it here. But if you're more along the lines of a casual gamer definitely walk away from this one.,Rust
424950,2016-05-04,0,0,467,False,Not Recommended,The game is fun and the idea behind it is incredible. You can literally do whatever you want.However the community is toxic and kinda sucks. It's super grindy and you'd have to put aside time to play almost every day so you can stay relevant on the server. That is until someone wipes you while you're offline. If you're solo HA. Good luck.,Rust
424951,2017-01-29,0,0,491,False,Recommended,posibly one of the most butiful games in term of grafics. but most importantly it is very fun the survival. there is now pvp and pve and i think it is more balanced now. still short of sucks when you play solo because of the zergs,Rust

Why the heck can't there be an online survival game for once that is not grindy at all and takes maybe a few hours to get decent equipment and discourages raiding? Pretty much every multiplayer survival turned out like rust A.K.A raids all the time.. Another thing is that they legit made the graphics from legacy to new like 100x better so people with bad computers who could run the game before now can't. Thanks Facepunch!

424987,2018-06-02,0,0,920,False,Recommended,The thing with Rust is where you play it. You can play on anything from Vanilla servers to Modded servers. I personally prefer some of the modded servers. The game is what you make it you can play team style or solo. The degree of difficulty depends a great deal on the server. The game is still being developed and there are occasional set backs but I think the positive outweighs the negative in that regard. Competition and lifespan are variable also. Challenge yourself on a vanilla server or chill on one of the modded servers it's personal preference and how you play the game. I bought this game as an early release and I have logged a lot of fun hours playing it. There are so many fun aspects to Rust.,Rust

The adrenaline pvp making bases everything seemed just so great about the gameThen they added loot tiers map.Ever since then you spawn in like 1 7 spawn points which basically are all near each other and you're meant to get away from there as fast as possible because you're going to get camped by the people that were lucky to get a bow early and basically spawn kill you and oh boy are people s in this game. Doesn't matter if you have a sash or not you're going to get chased across the map for that rock and torch of yours. Did you just pick up a hemp near a fresh spawn? Well too ing bad because now he's going to chase you across half the map just to try and kill you and ruin your start just because they can.Then comes the interaction with the community which is almost nonexistant past fresh spawns. If a guy has a bow you can bet he's gonna shoot your sweet for no reason other than to kill you and maybe take the you got IF you got any that is.To the people who played this game for a pretty long time now. How many people have you talked to who have a bow without them trying to kill you? Because 95% of the time they're gonna draw that and kill you and Im guessing you weren't even taking the chances of talking with them because you probably were already aiming at him with your bow or spear.Clans rule the game It's been like that for a while if you have no one to play the game with you're usually gonna have a time. Honestly early game problems come from the loot tier map and how you just don't spawn around the map anymore thus increasing in density of people in one place and like 20% of the people making out of there without getting attacked by a guy with a bow.In the end ill still play it because i enjoy the pvp and base building but these are the issues i seem to find the most troubling.,Rust
424997,2018-05-28,0,0,565,False,Recommended,GENERAL OVERVIEW Learning how to build/craft gets headshot by a bolty. ACTUAL REVIEW After playing more than 555 hours on rust I can say that it is a good game (besides the screaming naked asians).It is driven by the community you chose how to play whether it be Playing in a clan roleplaying as a merchant or ransacking someone's shop. There is a lot to do. Sadly this has become a problem. The community has grown in toxicity making new players quit after a few hours of playing. Due to this it will slowly die. But YOU can change it. Whether it be giving metal tools to a newman or not griefing someone's wooden house you decide what happens. Don't make the wrong choice.P.S. Very gud gam mest bye!,Rust

425003,2018-05-28,0,0,294,False,Recommended,This game is amazing! The progression system is currently perfect and although PvP is often stacked towards large clans but then again this is an issue with every survival game and a good player can outplay them in the right situations. One thing that holds this game back massively is the fact that the community is complete due to tryhards spawncamping freshies so that they cant build up but every now and then you find the right person who helps you along the way. One tip if you wish to avoid salt play community or modded servers because officials are near impposible to start on even on wipe day and they tend to be reserved for the best of the best. Also dont anger a big clan. you wont have fun unless your IQ is above 180. They'll demolish you.,Rust

Its a very fun game to play with friends and thats why I love it but it can also be a cruel game at times. You work so hard to build your base and gather materials to raid other players and you return to your own base comepletely destroyed is the worst feeling in the world. This game is not for the faint hearted as it will constantly be throwing obstacles at you that you have to mentally endure. I would also say that this is the best survival game out on steam currently. It had weekly updates and they show what they are working on and you can also suggest to the devs what you want to see changed.,Rust

Smart base planning.You have to plan every step you take and base everything around other player's actions.Walk the long way to avoid getting wrecked? Do it. Wait till a player is offline to raid them? Do it.The only thing you shouldn't do is get asshurt when you get raided and have to start from scratch just like you've left another player. It's just the cycle of Rust.Pros Nice weaponsNice crafting system.Nice building systemNice resource system (a bit grindy but eh)Cons Not enough animals. I find myself running around for ages to find 1 measly pig and have to wait to find another 2 just to build a furnace.The monuments need textures.More enemies. Bring back zombies and have them infest the monuments for a little more dangerFix the animal AI it's horrible they run in circles on mountains and get stuck in rocksNeeds more irradiation i mean this game appears to be post nuclear war so where's me rads?Yes i know this game's in Beta but it has been for 2 years and needs fixing.But I love the way it turns everybody into survival mode. The adrenaline rush is real when you see another player with weapons or players raiding another base or even attacking you. It's hard but it's so much fun. 8/10,Rust

425087,2016-09-12,0,0,527,False,Recommended,I like this game I've had it since legacy and i see it only improving but I would like to suggest some ideas to the developers (since I don't know where to post ideas to developers)1.Reduce the amount of time to actually use healing items (The bandage and the and Medical Syringe (cant tell you how many times I injected myself but still went down after a gunfight)) or stop the bleeding effects when applying medical items or just do away with the bleeding effects entirely (but this one is a stretch)2.Focus on horses instead of cars since most rust maps are mainly nature focused (if that makes sense) and the maps roads are only a small percentage of the map.3.Shields or some type of blocking methods to counteract melee attacks and archers (if shields are implemented) and to have better melee focused battles 4. (Controversial Opinion) Get rid of the twig system that allows people to build all the way to the top of the base and raid easily from there raiding should be challenging not a walk in a park where people can easily be offline raided. (and to some extend getting rid of ladders) Also this system makes walls next to usless limiting it to be more of a honeycomb.5.Make the food and water meter last a bit longer its somewhat of an annoyance at this point.6.Continuing on the shields I would structure it to having it on your back would protect your back only and not your head. When you equip your shield it should have three stances one where it protects your body (base stance) one where you hold right click to cover your head but somewhat reveal your body and the third stance which is when you crouch and hold right click for ultimate frontal protection but it leaves you slow and vulnerable to flanks and with these stances you should be able to hold a one handed melee and a spear for throwing and melee but no guns. There should also be catagories with light medium heavy and super heavy where small medium and heavy block arrows and give reduced damage to gunfire and while the catagories go up the shield gets slightly bigger and the durablility increases and the damage to gunfire is slighty reduced as you get higher and in these 3 catagories you can equip a melee weapon but for the super heavy shield you can't equip weapons but its bulletproof and it covers your entire view so you will need a buddy to point you in the right direction and its durability goes down as it gets shot up. Moving on to melee combat with shields it should be a timed block where if you block correctly you receive no damage and the fight continues until you dont block correctly your character should receive a staggering affect leaving you vulnerable giving your opponent a hit on you and the fight continues until one dies. That just leaves us with two handed weapons which should get the ability to block but the person wielding it should focus on dodging and the two handed weapon will be an anti shield weapon meaning it has an easier time breaking shields and the stagger affect is much greater if the shield person does not block properly.,Rust

The game is unstable as hell people playin suck very hard. I may get back in some years when this game is actually playable. It crashes fps drop every minute menu and interaction bugs on a 1000 euro pc. Nice... OLD UPDATE So after many months and many updates i think i should edit this review.Welcome to rust where everyone is hostile and a killing naked people with guns is really fun especialy if you are the one holding the gun. Drawing SO BAD STUFF on sings is also great!I used to have 3 hours to this game this number jumped to 30 just in 3 days while playing with a friend. The game is playable now even on low end pcs and i can handle the game almost on full settings. Its really fun to play and great looking! Also you will discover something new every time you play its basicly minecraft for psychopaths. I see so much potential to this title. I saw that they made the price 30 euros i could say its kinda worth it. Actually they made it 31 so you are forced to put more money on steam shady.

425105,2017-03-07,0,0,2867,False,Recommended,I really Like this game a lot and its really reccomended by me beacause its a great game and You can invite your friends to play it. Also when you start playing the game its going to be super hard but around 500hrs i think you will know everything about the game and be a great experienced player if not keep on trying until you you reach your goal with rust. I myself have played this game for 1 634.1 hrs now and i still think its so fun also if you get mad and frustrated at this game dont give up and say i cant do anything beacause you can i know it. The only downside with this game is that you have to be playing this game a lot to not get raided and specificly if you have a small base and if you do have a big base then its a really small chans of you getting raided unless its nolife 8 man clan farmers that will raid you then you might hide your loot.,Rust

425107,2018-02-19,0,0,561,False,Recommended,I daresay this is the best survival game available on Steam. It's composed of action grinding planning strategizing and that's what makes it so special and so addictive. There's really not much to say about it. The main core of the game is about building your own base gathering resources and raiding other players. The only things which I would consider as cons are too much darkness during the night and not exactly mature community (but the game istelf cannot be blamed for that right?). If you'd like to forfeit all your spare time then buy this game.,Rust

425112,2014-07-26,0,0,178,True,Not Recommended,FOR LATEST REVIEW SEE THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW.This game although is in Alpha as clearly stated is very playable and is great fun!Choose from over 5000 servers mostly UK and German servers and build and raid other bases.Make new friends and team up to suvive or brave it alone and shoot on sight.You get all kinds of people on Rust which is what makes the game so brilliant! The constant fear but also peacefulness of the surroundings.Updates for this game are regular and the devs are contantly trying to improve the game. I bought this game instead of buying DayZ because 1) it was cheaper2) didn't require a super computer to run3) and for the ability to build in an open world game all kinds of stuff from huge bases to a camp fire.Edit After 176 hours of playing this game it has changed very much to when I first reviwed this game. All of the above still is relevent. The requirements have maybe increased a little but I am still running it. The game is visually stunning! I have teamed up with many people on this game I have also killed many people and most of all be killed many time.Most of the time this game is a shoot on sight but depending on the server you join that can really change and people will help you and will let you live with them in the game. I have even been on a server where a group of 6 people controlled a rather large section of the map.9/10 because it's still Alpha and there are still things not complete but that is expected.Edit 2 30/05/2015This game is now uninstalled and now to most likely never be played again. This is because of a few reasons 1)Optimisation is complete rubbish and even if you have a great computer it will most likely run crap.2) Hackers ruin everything and has been something that the devs have done nothing about it seems.3) Spend hours of your life playing this and its wasted its a hitting stones simulator after a few hours of this game you will be killed 100 times starve 100 times but not achieve anything because everyone tom and harry are chasing after you. It's NOT WORTH A BUY! I bought this when it was 11 I'm glad I haven't been too ripped off but still ripped off.EDIT 10/05/2017 Still useless with poor optimisation and the devs just killed the game by bugging it out.

425122,2018-02-19,0,0,591,False,Recommended,"First things first Rust is not a survival game persay... It is a game about surviving in on island with no social contract. This game is the closest thing to a political vacuum that any of us will ever experience. This game brings out the caveman in us all the mistrust the fear the covetousness the vengefulness the connivingness and so much more that you never knew existed in yourself. There are brief glimpses of modern courtesy and humanity but they are vastly outweighed by the uncaring crushing force of our base nature. Rust gets one thing very right about survival Nature doesn't care if you live or die. Unfortunately there is only one real way to die in Rust which is what makes it different than the ideal survival game. Nature is mostly forgiving in this game there will always be mushrooms clean water cloth and firewood over the next hill. Human nature is the real killer you will die thousands of deaths by the hands of the cruel the fearful the determined and the jealous. Surviving is uncomplicated if you know how to avoid other players which any lone wolf player can confirm. There real challenge comes when you decide to look for FUN. Player interaction is inevitable the game will not force you into it but you will force yourself into it. After half an hour of gathering materials you will hear a gunshot or see a distant figure and you will be filled with an irresistable curiousity. If you steel yourself against it and slink back home the world will pass you by. You have everything to lose by avoiding your fellow man. That distant figure may be a potential ally a roleplayer who can entertain you for hours or a dying man whose misfortune will become your livelihood. It could be a hardened no lifer whose zerg clan will descend on your like biblical plagues. As you approach this figure your hands will tremble and your mind will be filled with self doubt and terror. The firearm you cling to holds your future in its chamber. Each missed bullet is another piece of your past and future that you throw away. But maybe you will not miss today or maybe you will not need to shoot. As you step out from your hiding place weapon raised your target turns to face you. Their face is filled with surprise and they cry out ""No wait I'm friendly! Please don't I'm looking for a friend."" Are they lying? Are they trying to protect valuable goods? Are there hidden cries for the aid of unseen companions behind their pleas for mercy? How long do you have until some other vulture descends on this feast? Is this what you've become a vulture? This is where your story will truly begin. And believe me when I say that there will be stories. There will be tragedies that fill you with self hatred and shame. There will be comedies where new friends are made and many laughs are had. There will be epics where you defy the odds even just for a minute before the island crushes you into nothingness. You will have to make your fun. You will have to endure the slow grinding parts to make it to the climax. After every wipe you will have to ask yourself how much have I given and how much more am I willing to give? In my case my answer to the first question is that I've given over 500 hours since I first purchased this game in early access in 2013. I cannot answer the second question.LONG LIVE THE NAKAMAT TRIBE. DEATH TO THE TOWER PEOPLE.",Rust

I am wating until something BIG happens to the game so I can play this more often. It's just very slow as of right now and I've done it all and have had my fun. Eventully I'll come play this game 24/7 again. Alll games have toxic communities and when people complain about them with over 500 hours on the game I laugh. Don't write a bad review if you have more hours then me sure you may have liked the old rust but that does not mean this is the only game you are able to play. New games are made everyday.

This game Although its not terrible very fun massive potential but the communitiy or atleast 1 in 3 people whom you'll never pick out of the crowd untill it's too late are out to kill everything in sight hen crywhen they die.Base Both your survival and deathTorch stay away. ( the big shoot me beacon)Players stay away or likely get shot. ( 1 in 3 players will have guns and happily test them out on your head If they don't have guns and you do Goes without saying not to give them any)Rocks.. can't live without em love em.. but players with em... haha stay away from nudis with rocks... lolNow I'm sure theres alot of this roaming around Game is amazing But if you are the type that hates farming Bi weekly(not literally) mandatory server wipes base trolls or hacker like accuracy with the least accurate guns in the game at some points (due to lag on one end or the other) Then this game is not for you.

425169,2013-12-18,0,0,31,True,Recommended,Rust is by far the most impressive early access/alpha build games I've ever bought. Just the fact that it's alpha but the lighting is magnificent and there are so many features that seem so fluid already. I spent my whole afternoon playing this with friends and in that time I'd found my friend we then killed zombies for blue prints and looted the nearby radtown constantly building up a nice supply of items we made an alliance with two friendly players whom helped us out immensely we met up with another 2 friends and then we started making out base. It's funny though we ended up with the best weapons we could get surplus ammunition decent clothing and a whole host of weapon addons but we we're still defeated by zombies when we went on an expedition. This game is really about survival no matter what you have you can still be as easily killed as the next guy over. The periodic supply drops are interesting hearying the plane go overhead watching the cannisters parachute to the ground and then running in that direction hoping to find them before any other players though it can be quite frustrating when they land on mountains that have no way of climbing.If you have a bunch of friends to play this with I would highly recommend buying Rust sure it's fun solo but it's worth it to play with friends and to co ordinate and build large fortress like bases. The upcoming features are really going to make this game stand out from all the other survival games on the market.,Rust

I personally feel like the game keeps getting better and am glad that the developers are constantly adding on to the game. I definitely agree that a lot of people can be toxic in the Rust community but I have also made plenty of friends on Rust. I think it all comes down to finding the right server. There are plenty of servers to choose from if you are just looking for a PVE experience or a PVP experience. At times I can get bored and not play for awhile but I always end up coming back for more. Definitely an awesome game to play with a bunch of friends.,Rust

425245,2016-07-09,0,0,153,False,Not Recommended,"Originally I recommended this game under the condition that you be prepared for what is one of the worst communities of any game you'll ever play with. Of course it wasn't always this bad. In the glory days of rust you were only killed on sight by maybe 4 out of 10 people. That was manageable and it didn't destroy the experience of a game that relies so heavily on the people you play with. But as more and more people come to this game due to it's increasing popularity despite the fact you have zero loot you'll find yourself being KOS'd pretty much 100% of the time usually by some 14 year old who manages to squeak out ""f ggot"" before you bleed out.This means that the only instance in which you can survive the grind to a point where you can defend yourself is on a freshly wiped server where everyone else starts on an even playing field. You can forget joining servers that were wiped the day before as a single day is plenty of time for players to get semis and AK's.The more I play this game the more I realise this isn't something I can recommend to new/solo players. You may get lucky and find a random group that would take you in but the gameplay experience shouldn't rely on luck to be fun. It really is a shame too because the core gameplay is so well designed compared to other survival games like ARK. Your only chance is to search the forums and discords for a group of players looking for more people. Other than that you're out of luck.",Rust

425257,2018-04-19,0,0,415,False,Not Recommended,"This game was incredibly awesome when I first started playing a few years ago. Everything was new survival was extremely challenging and although there were some jerks out there overall the community was just as noob as I was and for the most part we worked together. The game has progressed well due in large part to the great development team. They keep the community updated with darn near every change they make and drop hints as to what lies ahead. With that team I have no complaints.However the community has become extremely toxic and KOS (kill on site) has become the norm not the exception. Fully geared mobs roam the island a day or two after wipe day and do all they can to make life a living hell for newly spawned nakeds. There is almost no cooperation on either sponsored or community servers except for real life friends that you dragged into the game to join in your misery. Then just as you finally get a base up and a perhaps get a gun it's wipe day and you have to start the whole process over. If you get really good and you have a skilled group you can rise to the challenge and compete with the other mobs. But whether you win or lose there will be massive amounts of cussing and cursing in chat and over in game audio. Toxic.Finally I saved the best for last. This is ultimately why I gave the game a negative review. Not because of the toxic community. Not because of the endless cycle of scavenge build die repeat. But because of the terrible ban system. I have zero count em ZERO cheats hacks modifiers etc. on my machine. I have put in 415 hours of clean playing into this game. And suddenly with no warning I am ""gamebanned"" and can never play online again. WTF? Once again I have never had any modifiers on my machine for this game. To make matters worse there is no recourse. Valve gives the power to ban solely on the developer and then wipes their hands of it. Yes Easy Anti Cheat are the idiots who banned a clean player but I paid Valve for the game. Ultimately it is their responsibility to ensure that the developer does not abuse this right. And clearly EAC doesn't know what they're doing. When searching for a way to contest the ban all I could find from EAC is that all bans are final and that there is NO inquiry system. So when they screw up and ban someone unnecessarily (which happens all the time just Google their track record... it's horrendous) there is no way to enjoy the game from there on out. And they never tell you why because ""then the cheat developers would know"". I'm sure those guys know very quickly either way. So at the severe cost of customer service EAC chooses to ban and run.

The dev team is still pretty great however I feel they try to micromanage somethings a little too much like with the roof exploit which gave smaller groups/solos a better chance against large clans that rule servers. The community has become straight unless you're a popular youtuber or one of the high and mighty of the server aka a member of the giant zerg clan that destroys everything. Your experience now is pretty much getting shot at by anyone mauled by most animals and spending your entire time grinding to pop down a base only to get mowed over by the first guy to pop up with a crappy gun.

425310,2017-05-25,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,Having spent a fair bit of time watching the forums I'd say the dev clearly cares very little whether or not people are enjoying the game. That or they kowtow to the vocal minority of old time players whose idea of a fun game is very different from the majority's.Due to this the game only gets new people during sales and hemmorrhages them between sales http //steamcharts.com/app/252490My personal peeve with the game is the stubborn refusal to allow character customization not even if it's only available once at the start. The reasons given are many and varied and not one of them holds water versus the vast majority of users being entirely for it. From what I see it's a matter of being too lazy to create an interface for it and/or some misguided SJW agenda about forcing everyone to live in racial harmony which clearly doesn't happen even without customization.I'd just say don't do it. I know it's only 20 bucks even when it's not on sale but there are cheaper ways to bang your head against a brick wall.,Rust

425321,2016-11-26,0,0,920,True,Recommended,I had this game for a while but didn't play it much because of how hard entry is to new players. After coming back with some friends (everything is funner with friends!) I have found the game to be much more enjoyable. I have to commend the devolpers for updating this game and listening to feed back. It is of my opinion that they should stop listening to reddit though. Rust is intense and fun where the stakes are high. There are numerous obstacles in the way of players such as radiation hunger thirst and wildlife. Those are nothing to other players who can and WILL gut you like a fish for just being in there territory. Eventually this game will get a proper release I'm sure but it still is trying to figure out what kind of game it is.,Rust

425385,2018-06-06,0,0,576,False,Recommended,The creators actively update the game adding new content and polishing the systems. One thing that I was glad to notice is that the game mechanics incentives playing in a less toxic way there is no achievements for killing players (it will still be necessary some times) but usually is much better to trade with them. Upkeep mechanics make the clans work harder to keep their bases and the new damage output on the missiles and C4 make raiding a lot more difficult for them. You can counter clans with traps more easily. Im a solo player and I have been able to play wipe to wipe with a big size base no problem. And even survive 4 raid attempts from clans. Also the skins are really great and Im glad to spend money on them each week.,Rust

425394,2013-12-29,0,0,38,True,Recommended,This game is a survival and resource collecting with a hint of pvp danger type of game. Since its in Alpha there is no tutorial which I think is the biggest flaw and 2nd is when you log off and log back in all your stuff on your person disappears. Now you can prevent this by putting them in a container. You are limited on what you can craft which is enough to survive but not enough to get that shotgun to murder all those innocent zombie guys. You have to either A) Find a blue print that lets you learn how to build it or B) Find a shotgun that you loot and kill zombies to you get a research kit which allows you to make the object that you already possess. That feature is really handy cause the next time you log in you might not have that shotgun. For me this game satisfied something minecraft or DayZ(not including alpha version you can buy) or nether could not.,Rust

425402,2018-04-29,0,0,227,False,Recommended,"This game is brutally based on the concept of survival.Over the course of its development the devs have allowed modding to stay in the game as long as it is restricted to certain servers. Thankfully the devs listen to what we as players have to say about the game.The game play itself is unlike many I have ever seen survival is hard enough as i had to run around desperately looking for food while starving but i couldn't find any as all the supermarkets in the area were looted. There were no animals in the area to kill and for the first time in a while I found myself battling a concept in a video game I never thought i would have problems with. Typically there are 3 different types of enemy you can encounter who can and will attempt to kill you.1. Players The community is known for its toxicity that shows in the form of racism sexism and otherwise homophobic comments. Due to this games extremely toxic community you should avoid trusting other players with well anything. After someone as decided they want to kill you they will unlikely stop chasing you until you are dead e.g. I had just spawned and I found myself being chased by a naked with a rock who would smack me every time he got the chance. Eventually he gave up and ran off. Sadly the more geared players will often kill fresh spawns for no apparent reason so avoiding contact with further developed players is recommended. 2. Animals Annoyingly somewhere about maybe a year or two ago animals could glitch through walls/foundations and begin attcking you inside your own base. Around that time they were also even more unforgiving than the players and their AI would not stop targeting you until you were dead or moved out of their aggro range. This is sadly nearly improssible to do as most animals are either faster or just as fast as you are. Some advice to newer players is that after you kill a wolf you should not crush its skull for bones as it can be used to craft pretty much the best ""primitive"" helmet the wolf headress.3. Military. There are four military enemies including the scientist the helicopter the chinook and bradley the apc. All of these npcs are hostile but are difficult to defeat with the exception of the scientist. THe heli is an npc that has long been in the game which patrols the entire map before dissapearig and respawning later. It targets players with armour or gunpowder weapons/guns. The chinook is also a helicopter however after a certain time of patrolling an area and gunning down players (including nakeds) it drops a form of airdrop which typically has better loot than a normal airdrop an its location is marked on the map for everyone to see. The scientist is an npc that can be found roaming the military tunnels or nearby junk piles. They are armed with guns and shoot once you are within aggro range. They usually have mid tier loot on them such as med syringes. Bradley is an apc tank and like the scientist and chinook will shoot regardless of whether or not the player in question is geared or not. They spawn only in launch site and are armed with a primary and secondary weapon that either fires tank shells or guns you down with a turret.",Rust

Legacy gave me my most immersive and exciting gaming experience that I've ever had and even far beyond any AAA title that I've ever played.I wish the developers could see it from our point of view but I think they're just in it to milk it. If they would just ditch the experimental project and continue to make Rust legacy a lot better than it is now I think they could resurrect what Rust once was. c,Rust
425420,2016-01-27,0,0,579,False,Recommended,I have 575 hours logged into Rust as of now.This game was in development for over 3 years and every two weeks for every single month with only a handful of breaks in between they updated and added new stuff. They never ever gave up on the game and even included Community updates and reached out to fans to promote fan art and content creators. They listened to the community and made changes and tried new things in the end they succeeded. I have played every iteration of Rust from the VERY VERY early to the zombies rad animals and the new version which premiered as vast empty fields where you ran around with only a bolt action rifle without being able to aim down sights firing bullets that arked like tennis balls and glowed like star wars lasers.While I guess the final version of the Legacy Rust is going to be something people talk about in reviews I say this is the better version. Legacy is forever burned into my memory. I spent countless hours playing it with a friend who passed away before the new version came to be so I understand the memories and quirky charm it had. But aside from that it lacked content and it lacked more refined mechanics.Garry Newman wanted to create a successor to Day Z after he was frustrated by the lack of updates the game had and wound up redefining the survival genera. What started as a zombie game turned into a brutal social sandbox where some of the most complicated interactions I have ever had with other users in a video game occurred. Factions wars rivalries pranks trolling and even acts of kindness carry weight behind them that few if any game has ever captured before.In a weird way you almost learn about human behavior where 0 accountability and high stakes pushes some people into becoming monsters. How massive groups of people faction together form alliances break them and in some cases resulting in civil wars. The randomly generated terrain are nice but what really gets me are the buildings. You can come across bases some that rival small cites completely abandoned with an odd player building a small fort inside of it. I have found fully realized towns with signs layouts and even a giant shrine. It was abandoned and had walls missing from rockets it felt eerie to wonder what had happened and why. Exploring the decaying remains of a these once impregnatable fortress always feel fresh and interesting like exploring an abandoned ship hoping to find some treasure inside.This game is not for everyone. It is harsh brutal and unpredictable like nature. No other survival game captures the feeling of raw nature like rust where each experience or encounter can lead to unforgettable stories.,Rust

425425,2017-08-31,0,0,1051,False,Not Recommended,In short no end game repetitive gameplay you need to commit to gaming daily npcs are too easy solo trios are penalized by not being in a big enough group zerg focused gameplay updates never fixed player concerns and they hardly got addressed overall stale game after one or two wipes not worth the $30+ pricetag it has i got it on special for $10 atleast I got my moneys worth before the game took a nosediveGame was decent before now it penalizes you if you cannot commit to gaming daily. Back then you could join a server late and still be able to compete with other players now you start out handicaped and have to grind an insane amount to even compete. It seems that update after update the developers want to emphasize that you need to be in a zerg inorder to have a chance in the game as progression in a zerg is way too quick example zerg can get end game items day one while a solo trio can't get all end game items by next wipe unless you join a montly wipe server which tend to be empty because zergs end up being too powerful and snowball. Biggest issue of game is there really is no end game and game gets too repetitive after your second or third wipe. Needs more npcs that make the game harder for both heavily geared players and beginers. After you get above bow phase the animal npcs are no threat the other npcs aren't that good either as you can easily dodge the tank and the helicopter won't attack you if you unequip items there is no real difficulty in this game from the environment. Just stale gameplay. Even pve servers for people who like the roleplaying aspect of the game is way too boring as the wildlife isn't challenging.,Rust

There are a lot of items you can play around with and you can design your own base however you want. The graphics are clear and crisp and the combat is intense. You can see the bright tracers light people up in the air. The gun sounds are realistic and loud. They are also balanced in recoil damage and range. A problem with the game is that on a lot of servers there are huge clans that I call ""Server Monopolies"" which basically dominate the server by taking over smaller groups and individual's. It is easy to get raided by them and you would have to be online a lot to keep track of your base.

If you don't want to grind and whine about having to do it this game isn't for you. If you suck at PvP and don't want to try to get better this game isn't for you.I wanted to give up my first week playing it. But I also mostly play solo.. which makes this game way more difficult and at times annoying. But in that challenge is what makes Rust a great game. When you succeed and make good progress Rust gives a very rewarding feeling of accomplishment. So I stuck with it. Everybody has their favorite aspects of the game. Personally I like base building and grinding for better BP's. The PvP is awesome even though I suck at it. It's a struggle.. which if this world was a reality it would be just as it is. You'd have good people (friendly) and your bad people (toxic..KOS) It is what it is. To find the balance you want you have to find the right server to play on. I have almost 1000 hours on record and I'm still not ready for large official servers. I don't blame the game. It's mostly because I don't have many Steam friends to join up and tackle the game. You will not make it long playing solo on a busy server. If you're new start out on a slow server. It will be easier to learn the grind build a base you prefer and have an easier time earning higher tier BP's. Eventually this will get boring as you will want to see more action. From there you just need to give it a try. If you have a good group of Steam friends that will enjoy playing with you then it will be even more enjoyable. Yes there are toxic players and clans that will make your life a living hell. But it is what it is. It's meant to be a gritty survival game. But again there are servers with admins that try to control the experience so it's enjoyable for all who play. You just have to sift through them. Most important you need to join during fresh wipes. If you join a server that hasn't been wiped for a while it is just going to be an uphill battle. But if you stick with it you'll find a server with a good group of MATURE people that offer challenge but don't aim to just be a D**k and keep killing you. Overall..Great graphics. I play on ""good"" setting and it still runs and looks amazing.Gameplay mechanics and physics are excellent. Not perfect but better than a lot of other games I've played. If you enjoy base building and foritfying this game is excellent for that.and the overall experience depends on your attitude and the server you play on. There are well balanced servers that allow the game to be enjoyable you just have to find the one that gives you the balance you're looking for. It is certainly challenging and if you embrace that and don't whine about it then Rust is the game for you!The only things I would change is tweak the sulfur to GP cost by 25%. And raise the % of finding higher tier weopons. It's hard enough to get them but then you need to research them. I don't think this will hurt gameplay but up the fairness for newer players to secure better weapons to defend themselves. Especially if they're joing later in a wiped server.9.5/10",Rust

This also has a battle royale mode which is pretty fast unlike PUBG or Fortnite. If you are looking for a fun survival game to play with friends then i suggest you pick this up.

425483,2017-01-14,0,0,480,False,Not Recommended,Don't do it don't buy it just do not. This game is incredibly PVP oriented but not in a fun aspect. The community is the most toxic i have ever seen. Anyone with a normal life job school responsibilities etc will not have a good time because you will spend 6+ hours a day grinding for resources to build a base and then get on by someone who spends every wake moment of their life playing this game who simply wipes your base to nothing. This game takes too much and is only for a small niche of people willing to invest their life to it. I know i did wasted a whole summer playing it. Once you buy this game you marry it. So in one last ditch effort to save others from the blackwhole of time that is this game i urge you to just buy something else instead or better yet not waste 35 dollars to have hundreds of hours of your life wasted to amount to nothing.,Rust

425503,2018-02-17,0,0,213,False,Not Recommended,I've had this game sence early to mid 2016 and at this point this game has lost it's charm for me. First rason and is the biggest problem I have with this game is the terrible community. For example I spawned in once after a wipe had nothing but my good old rock ok 2 guys fully geared with ak's come up to me and kill me. They said I was a threat to them. I thought to myself HOW THE F*CK IS A GUY WITH NOTHING BUT A ROCK A THREAT TO 2 GUYS FULLY GEARED WITH GUNS. This is one example. This has probably happened to me thousand's of times by now and now its just annoying. To me the only fun I have in this game now is playing and chilling on pve servers actually interacting with other players. I swear I've had more fun pve servers comunicating and teaming up with other people in the server to destroy the heli and the apc/tank. If you're willing to spend possibly hours or even days of work and possibley have it all go away in a matter of minutes sure go ahead get this game.,Rust

425526,2017-11-22,0,0,559,False,Not Recommended,Rust is A fun game when you sit down with your friends and have a good time there are many things to do in rust from hitting trees to killing naked people who just woke up. While rust is a good game and it excels where many other survival games have failed such as good graphics monthly promising updates and a excelent dev team at the ready it also has alot of flaws and somewhat feels not ready. The Game is good dont get me wrong i still enjoy and play this game but its current updates have been turning me off from playing. It is almost impossible to play as a solo player now its been said multiple times and im saying it now rust with friends is rust without friends rust is not playable in its current state your better off becoming a pvp legend with no base. in the most recent update where player bodies float i dont know if it is a servers issue or not but stuff doesnt float when it should boats are a good step in the direction of rust but theyre so uncontrolable its terrible. A.I driven players (scientists) are a good idea but in their current form no road or powerline is safe from anyone as they will shoot theire pistol like an ak and have the accuracy of a hacker. chinook event is cool and helps alot of new players catch up but at the moment ive seen bradley kill the chinook 5 times leaving the crate up for anyone who can go in begin the hack and hide under the rocket for 15 minutes. the decay whilest it has been nerfed is still too high for these big bases the biggest base probobly houses 500 chests and is easily broken into. tool cupboard still has a very low amount of slots that you can put stuff into. and its starting to become a one base beats all scenario. now i love this game i really do but i feel like the game shouldnt have been rushed out of EA along with other titles such as subnautica which in itself should also be looked at before purchase.,Rust

425531,2018-06-10,0,0,109,False,Recommended,The fun of this game depends on the kind of server you find. You can go from the most toxic kill on sight no chance to farm hellscape that forces you mute voice chat to a zombie apocolypse server where strangers running by rescue you from certain death and throw you some meat and a pickaxe before they're back on their merry way to stock their RP weapon shop. Best played with friends for raids and base building although you can go solo on the right server (with fewer people milling about looking to oneshot strays). With the right friends it can be fun to be killed gathering wood or have your stolen from strangers because of the ridiculousness of it. You can plot revenge raids and create trap bases that force players to off themselves to get free. Be creative for maximum fun.However I got tired of the obligatory server resets erasing all of my work and having to start from zero constantly. It was nice to start fresh for awhile because it put everyone including the decked out players/teams back on even playing field but that doesn't last long. Eventually I was just over mining for stone and metal frags just to strengthen my base to protect more stone and metal frags inside my base.After awhile the game just never offered anything more than mindless farming and anxious visits to common loot areas trying to avoid getting killed while you have 250 scrap in your pack. Still worth playing for awhile. Try different servers don't trust anyone and save your scrap.,Rust

We were building a house a guy came in mowed us both down with a AK 47 put a lock on my new noob house and made it his own. lol... I had a sleeping bag outside in a bush I ran back and said I want my house back... Knocked on the door.... he opened the door shot me and said my house you go build new house... 10/10 would respawn asking for my house again.Edit Been playing rust for awhile now I must say I would never play on FacePunch servers Community and modded servers are the best. 100 Airplanes modded server is by far the worst experience I've had playing this game. Stay away from anything related to MeatCircus. Modded servers are fun but server owners are uckers. Rusty Forest x10 is a horrible server and I would not recommend supporting that server admin plays on server and builds in rocks have proof if you want to see.Edit July 25th 2016This game has gone from pretty good to a compete game with the new xp changes. I'm sorry but exp systems in survival games is not appealing at all. Should have just let the way it was. If its not broken don't with it. The owner of this company is a complete ing joke and doesn't listen to the community at all when it comes to feed back. Get your ing together FB before you lose your entire playerbase. Struggles out.Heres an update Modded Servers are corrupt and a waste of time poor admins and staff. I wouldn't recommend and modded servers at this time. Rusty Forest is yet another server who has admin abuse and abusing staff I would not recommend playing on that server or donating. I wasted $40.00 usd never again will i donate to a server. Admin abuse and cheating.. Proof of admin building in rocks with a clan on server. PM for proof.Edit Sept 15th 2016So I played Rust the other day and since they have a componet system now its not that bad. Much better than bp's and exp. Modded servers are still an overall show... speaking of which I got all my donation money back from that corrupt Rusty Forest Server. ) them. Other than that its a decent game.Edit Nov 28th 2016 Garry Newman. Don't like negative reviews don't be a twat. #PCGamer article.2018/02/09 Glad to finally see it come out of early access.,Rust

Know this All servers have to be wiped after 4 to 7 days if the server has few players (not talking about vanilla servers which are a pain in the anyway) after all the work you have done you can say goodbye to all your stuff and start over. This has become a slave simulator in which you are the slave to yourself it's not fun sure the game looks pretty if you have the juice to run it at its best for some time it looked like they were only working on graphics which i can't even say how much i don't ing care and now they even started working on a NEW GAME...

425605,2016-01-24,0,0,289,True,Not Recommended,Rust is fun but really bad for a game in alpha. The game is badly optimized my brother plays the game maxed out with a gtx 670. I have 1000 times better computer and i play at lowest and the game will still lag soo bad that not even my computer can work. The game lags and gives you server errors eac disconnected so that you would have to go into the game files give the game administator permmision turn off your antivirus and then launch it from steam. The servers are ing trash. My character throws his tools randomly. The servers do never contain blueprints and all that. All servers are pretty empty no stone it s impossible to find something good expect for some servers. And when you go look at videos where people find these barrels that they can break and get bows and canned food. You will almost never find what you see in this game. You will die almost instanly. I spawn and mine a tree for 5 secs later im dead. And that happens everytime. Everywhere you go there is a base. The game map is so empty. And you will almost never find anyone expect for someone who has built a base and kill you the second you spawn. I know the game is in alpha but Oh god horribe. Try to find your friend get shoot. The admins abuse. And it s filled with hackers. The things that happen on videos are something you will never find.,Rust

If you don't or can't work with other friends to build a base and defend yourself and even more if you join a server after it has been online without being wiped for a couple of days it becomes frustrating because everyone will just try to shoot you dead even if you just spawned and had nothing but a stone and a torch.I actually liked when zombies were reintroduced for Halloween they were a nice addition especially when playing in my own server.,Rust

I understand its early access but its been over 5 months since the freezing and it still haven't been fixed. They're more worried on stupid items to put in the game than to focus on the one bug that other people have had since then. Conclusion dont waste money on a game that has dev's who failed to make 3 other games properly like DayZ.,Rust

425672,2017-12-02,0,0,325,True,Recommended,Awesome game with some bugs but cant complain its in alpha development. Really great to role play from a survival point of view. I enjoy the crafting system along with the blue prints to learn new things. I like playing with my brother and his friends because it adds a level of immersion to the game. Either work together or kill each other. So far I've meet really cool players here but again it depends on the server if your a new player. I recommend you head over to the community servers that are noob friendly many players will be glad to help! Also the game is good that I had to host my own Rust server now I get both of best worlds. Play in fun servers from other players and have players join my and helped them settle in and make new friends10/10 ..... actually 9/10one thing that bothers me to high heavens is the fact that there is so much stone everywhere but you cant mind it lol _,Rust

He came out of the house and shot me dead on his doorstep.Woke up on the shoreline of a wide river. Found a lighthouse. While scrounging for scrap and food was sniped from a nearby hill. Hobbled away swam across the currents of the river and attacked another survivor hoping his house might have some bandages and food. He ran away screaming. House had nothing.Found a few corpses and found some clothes a steel mace and a bandana. Found a cave and went to sleep. Was killed in my sleep.Woke up by a abandoned port. Found a derelict ship. As the sun fell found a place to hide inside the ship. In the distance a wandering torch. Coming closer. Approached the torch and then suddenly the aggressor's torch went out. Doused my torch and took out a nasty weapon found in a box in the derelict. Complete darkness. Lit up my torch BAM I reel back half dead. He was waiting for me after all.Doused my torch got down on my knees waiting. The shadow of the nearby moon lit the figure's shadow. Swiped madly but nothing just air. The figure had disappeared and I was alone. Again.Found a quiet abandoned house and went to sleep. Woke up. Found a cave that went into the earth for an endless depth. Tripped and fell down a long long chasm. Not sure how I survived. Found a pair of binoculars. Progress stopped with an enormous pit cross hatched with broken beams.Very very cold down here.Jumped across. Tripped and fell to the bottom of the pit. Could hear bones break. Crawled back up. Leaped again. Twisted my ankle and fell. but this time couldn't get up. Passed out at the bottom of the world but at least I had a pair of binoculars.Woke up naked on the side of a mountain.Twisted sense of humor this world.,Rust

425688,2016-04-04,0,0,545,True,Recommended,"After logging 300+ hours of this game I finally entered the Rustopia server with 3 friends. We spawn naked and afraid...there is 290 people online in this server. One of us gets lucky and gets a bunch of cloth which means he can make sleeping bags for the other 2 guys (sleeping bags acts as spawn points when you die). So we go in to the consol and suicide and spawn in the bags.We're at a beach. It looks beatiful as the sun is setting. But there is no time to marvel at the graphics. Time to farm materials to build a little cabin. As our cabin is taking shape and the tool cupboard is down (the tool cupboard acts as a building blocker for anyone who isnt authorized on it) we venture out with bows and encounter our neighbours not far away. They viciously attack us with crossbows and waterpipe shotguns. One of us goes down in a heartbeat and starts screaming on the ground...Im thinking to my self we are ed. I cant get to him and save him in time but I can revenge his death. Me and my friend who is still alive keep our distance and headshot all 3 attackers and kill them. I scream in TS as I loot them and the adrenaline is pumping. We get a ton of loot and enter our cabin and hide the loot.Our 3rd friend who died spawns in again after a 200sec wait and we venture of to farm animals for animal fat and cloth. As we are up on a hill we encounter a naked man with a rock. My ptsd instantly kicks in from the fight before and I put an arrow in his shoulder. He screams ""Im friendly please dont kill me!!"". I come to my senses. Now we're standing there in a circle trying to apologize to this naked man with a rock.In my periferal vision I see a person with a waterpipe shotgun and a metal facemask. It must be our trigger happy french neighbours. I yell attack and charge with my own waterpipe and crosbow.The chase is on. The metal face maske is retreating in a military fashion swivelling between bushes and rocks.Oh no...it's a trap. My hot temper finally got to me. There is 3 of them. They are all attacking us...and somehow the naked guy with the rock is taking advantage of the situation as well as he is chasing me with his rock trying to bash my head in. But the 3 people that just attacked us is now fighting each other as well. What is going on...is my last thought as I get an arrow in the head.My two friends rage quit and do a fresh spawn and try to build somewhere else. I do not. I spawn in at the cover of darkness and return to our cabin. It has been raided by who I can only presume is our french neighbour. I do a pitty knock on the door and say hello in the most pathetic way...A teenage boy awnsers. Clearly not french...maybe dutch?He asks me if I want to come inside and hide during the night. He has a fire going and some food on the way.I accept.As I enter my old cabin I see that it has been redecorated. Nothing fancy just different. I tell the boy I use to live here. After some talking we realise that he was the metal face mask from before...My ptsd from the french got the better of me and I attacked an innocent bystandard that was just there to farm some animals.As we come to terms with the whole ordeal he invites me to his base. As we are about to leave the cabin as the sun is rising there is a knock on the door...I think to my self ""What now!?"".It's a russian dude. He is saying ""Hello...come out plz...is iz new player""I say to my new friend ""It's a trap dude dont open the door man..."". We device a plan that I will be his meatshield as I have nothing to lose. He opens the door and hides behind it as I peek out. I see the russian dude.Behind him in a brush there is a guys in hide clothes with a waterpipe shotgun. He blasts me in the face as my newly found friend closes the door just in time for me to no die.We're stuck...we're like a fox in a fox den just waiting to be smoked out. I realize I have a sleeping bag at the beach from before so I say good bye to my newly found friend and die. I spawn at the beach use my stealth to get back to the cabin. I see the naked russian and the guy with the waterpipe.I yell ""CHARGE!!!"" and rush him with my rock. I hit the waterpipe guy in the head as my new friend rush out of the cabin and starts blasting him with a waterpipe shotgun. The enemy is dead and I get his loot. The naked russian is no where to be found...sly son of a .My new friend takes me to his fortress. Outside is a little 2x3 house that has a sign on it ""Fighters Camp"". I get a room in it with a bed and some storage. One other guy joins in as a fighter as well thru the global chat system on the server. As we settle in its time to head back to the god awful place I once called home...to farm some animals. Its me the other fighter and our lord and savior the teenage boy that rescude me from this tragedy.We farm an animal or two with our bows as we see a naked person with spear. It fits the description of the naked russian we encounter. We take pursuit.But not for long...7 FULLY GEARD people with ak's shows up behind a hill. We got to focused on reveng and let our guards down. The other fighter goes down with a headshot while the dutch boy screams ""RUUUN!!!"". I do as he says no further explanation needed.The dutch boy goes down...he screams. I'm to affraid to turn back to help him. I hear the finishing shots as he dies.I run...for about 1 2 minutes. I think they lost my trail. NO...they are close. I come up to a circulare base with a geared guy. I beg him to let me in so I can survive this onslaught. He says nothing.I hide in a bush outside his base as I hear the fully geared guys run past me. As I'm collecting my thoughts and trying to figure out how I will find my way back to camp I hear the door open to the base. The fully geared guy who did nothing to help me comes out. I greet him and he greats me. One of his friends comes out...he is naked. I walks up to me as I am about to greet him...he pulls out a hatchet and says "" you"" with a russian accent. As I see the hatchet coming at me I realise its the russian from before...but its to late.I ragequit. 10/10 will play again tomorrow.",Rust

425695,2018-07-13,0,0,12,False,Recommended,Toilet paper orientationA toilet paper roll has two possible orientations the toilet paper may hang over (in front of) or under (behind) the roll if perpendicular to the wall the two orientations are right left or near away. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference dictated by habit. In surveys of US consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists 60 70 percent of respondents prefer over. 1 Some people hold strong opinions on the matter advice columnist Ann Landers said that the subject was the most responded to (15 000 letters in 1986) and controversial issue in her column's history. Defenders of either position cite advantages ranging from aesthetics hospitality and cleanliness to paper conservation the ease of detaching individual squares and compatibility with setting specifics such as recreational vehicles or having pets. Some writers have proposed connections to age sex or political philosophy and survey evidence has shown a correlation with socioeconomic status.Solutions range from compromise to using separate dispensers or separate bathrooms entirely or simply ignoring the issue altogether. One man advocates a plan under which his country will standardize on a single forced orientation and at least one inventor hopes to popularize a new kind of toilet roll holder which swivels from one orientation to the other.,Rust

425730,2016-12-10,0,0,15,True,Not Recommended,Buy at your own risk. And please read reviews before you buy this game. The community is TOXIC.Any random servers it's very likely you're going to be killed on sight. KOS is everywhere. Not if you're a newspwan or a collector. Highly possible to get killed on sight with no question asked. The game has a mature building mechanics and plentiful items and nice graphics it's possbily by far the most developed survival/Early Access game out there. I personally think the game is like an upgraded Minecraft with a lot of matture building and construction mechanics. But gameplay has been bogged down to the pleasure of KOS there's no fun at all if you play at a populated server and trynna take 2 or 3 hours to get your own residence done. Because either way you're going to get killed by strangers at the process OR found out you're lying on a beach with nothing else after you log off the game for some time.Very unfriendly to new players. So there's some noob servers take some time to find one but whatever got killed either in noob server. No learning curve at all because you're just constantly getting killed don't even bother to learn the basics of the game. Unless you open your own server and lock it play a single player. If you enjoy raid and constantly getting killed buy this game. If you just want to build somethings or play nice don't even think about it.,Rust

Either you're forced to play on a community server that constantly wipes your blueprints and thus any progress you've made. Or you can play on officials that are constantly the target of hackers including vicious ddos attacks that leave the entire server helpless.It's sad because they're STILL adding worthwhile content to the game despite the core system being fundamentally flawed. They can tweak the loot tables and such but ultimately modded servers will be completely different anyway so someone who wants the ""core"" Rust experience is forced to choose an official server that will always be hacker infested and subject to ddos.Also the community has gotten worse every year and exponentially worse since it left EA.",Rust

However no game is perfect and rust comes with issues that need to be addressed. First off the performance issues I got a decent laptop that runs most AAA titles on the highest preset at 60+ fps but rust it fails to maintain that value even on the lowest preset additionally the game lacks actual end game content. There is no true motiv to reach the top other than raiding fresh people and making their days crappy. Overall game is good but fix the perfomance issues and add more content.,Rust

425760,2018-04-06,0,0,20,False,Not Recommended,TLDR I want to like it but it just isn't fun due to the necessity of constant activity in the server you are on or a large group of people to split the activity 24/7. Overall I hated the experience with the game (other than the guitar. That's a gem). On top of this the community is extremely toxic. I really wish this game was enjoyable to me because the idea is wonderful but it just isn't enjoyable. I played the game about a half a year or so ago with some friends and it was relatively enjoyable. That was until we had to get back to our usual lives and were therefore unable to be on relatively consistently. At that point we ended up loosing everything rebuilding to an even further point loosing everything again rebuilding again and then loosing it all again. This was a result of us not being on at 3 o'clock in the morning and therefore getting raided and killed with absolutely nothing we could do about it. I then uninstalled the game because I didn't feel like wasting hours of my time trying to build stuff up only to loose it because I'm unable to be online 24/7. After a year and a half I decided to try it agian per my buddy's request. This time I come to another conclusion that is very similar. We tried to start and found a server that was relatively busy but not overly populated. Each time when trying to meet up we would get attacked and killed by people with guns and bows and all that with high end gear. This was on a server that had been wiped the day before. We kept trying but after about the 7th or so time trying to meet up I decided to once again uninstall the game as it just isn't fun at all. Not to mention the community is overly toxic. At one point a clan of about 20 or so people teamed up on me and my two friends and hunted us down even after killing us once and us moving elsewhere. It just isn't enjoyable. You build everything up only to have it taken away without any chance to stop it. If you were able to play the game with only your group of friends easily it would probably be amazing but in its current state it is absolutely terrible. I hate to say that because I want to like it as the concept is nice but the execution is terrible. I shouldn't have to play the game 24/7 in order to progress. I shouldn't have to have a rotating team of people to always be online so that I don't loose everything for actually living a real life. In the moments were my friends and I were actually able to play the game we absolutely loved it (especially the guitar. That's the highlight). So overall it's an interesting take on this style of game but it just isn't enjoyable if you can't dump tons of time into the game or if you don't have a large team (probably around 10 or so people) to rotate activity. I wish I could like this game but I just can't. It's not fun to build everything up with your friends only to have it ripped away when none of you are on because you can't be on all the time.,Rust

425766,2017-10-07,0,0,2625,True,Recommended,This game is fantastic. The PVP is intense the sounds are realistic. I actually hate pvp but my husband loves it and I do go with him at his request to hunt players. I get soooo scared in pvp in this game because you can actually lose things that you've worked hard to earn. Some people may think that's a con but honestly I believe that the ability to lose your time is a boon in games. The fear aspect makes your heart race and makes it exiting. So many times we've gotten angry and quit over pvp only to come back because there are so many aspects of it that we love that keep us coming back.Personally I love the building. I love creating as massive a base as we can designing it to be a maze. We try different methods to make it more secure each time we build. I love the upgrading of the base. I love the farming tool crafting hunting animals even if on some servers the navmesh is disabled and they are stationary. We enjoy trying to snipe animals from as far away as possible. Fighting the helicopter is so thrilling. I used to just shoot at it to have it engage me because I would laugh out loud at parts of my base falling to pieces when it gets napalmed. Now we actually build towers and reinforce them to take it out.Many people complain about the recent update. I enjoy it so far. I believe it slows down the game a bit. It used to be that when a server wiped you'd have the players that server jump just to build get guns make one or two c4 and raid your base early. Now they have to actually play for an amount of time to do anything and time invested yields reward.I find it amusing that someone gave the game a negative review calling it garbage after he played it for 1 000 hours. My only guess is that he rage quit as we often have and wrote a review while upset. I certainly wouldn't invest 1000 hours in a game that I call garbage. This game is cheap and is amazing. But you need friends or a companion to play it with you. That's when it's is amazing. I only enjoy it alone when there are no players to fight against (Dead server) I actually purchased a server recently with the intention of it being just my husband and me playing on the server and was surprised that apparently buying a premium server with great ping brings flocks of players. I live in fear (and excitement) but I organize and strengthen our base and sneak around farming as my husband pvps and draws me from my nest to occasionally scout for enemies as he burns down doors.,Rust

425796,2018-01-06,0,0,110,True,Recommended,I can recommend this game if you have at least 4 friends to play with and you are into resource gathering and progression in techs and so on. It's cool learning the blueprints and grinding for items and blue prints. It's a good time coordinating with friends in a more serious version of minecraft to put it that way.I cannot recommend this game if people that kill you on sight are going to trigger you. Or if everybody double crosses you at every turn. Build up a small community that farms together and has each others backs and kill on sight yourselves and raid the hell out of people that annoy you. Otherwise you are wasting your time since going to the places with good loot will get you killed. Gathering resources will get you killed. Spawning will get you killed. Dedicated PVE servers would suite a certain player base and that player base that wants to play PVE will have a very hard time getting anywhere that feels accomplished in Rust,Rust

It really isn't very hard to get started even solo and build a decent base but you can't expect everyone you encounter to want to help you because that's just delusional. The beauty of this game is it's crazy pvp and the rivalries formed to battle for territory 11/10 would recommend to anyone who isn't going to cry about getting killed in a pvp game.

The new max group 1 2 3 4 5 servers make it so you and your tightly knit group of friends can thrive and not get dominated by groups of 20+. Best survival game yet imo. BUY IT. Some servers do have admin abuse going on so if you run into admin abuse just report it to facepunch and continue searching for a fair and balanced server. I recommend playing servers with LOTS of components so that you can make armored doors easier because whether or not someone can raid you depends on how much sulfur they can get and how little armored doors you can make.,Rust

With this recent blue print update I feel the amount of scrap for things is a bit high. But after all of the game reviewing it and looking at it I wouldn't trade Rust for anything because Rust is all around to fun I highly recommend finding a good group of people to play with solo in Rust is very hard so for a just starting out player try finding someone who will take you in and help you granted it will be very hard but if you try hard enough you will find the special someone. Rust is a great and amazing game and I feel everyone should at least give it a chance and form there oppinions around that.

425892,2016-12-27,0,0,41,True,Recommended,Its alright.Probably one of the more basic survival games out there. easy to play.All you have to do is play for a weeks (unless you are on a modded server) Build up supplies then raid your neighbors while they are offline.I feel like there needs to be offline raid protection. maybe there is? but ive not seen any servers like that.This is kinda discouraging for new players. You come into a game get set up collect resources log off and go to bed. Then wake up and all your stuffs gone and now there are holes and doors blown out every where. But once you get settled and learn how to secure your items and base a little more the games experience changes for the better. I dont feel there is any buyers remorse for buying this at full price.

425894,2016-08-15,0,0,1935,False,Not Recommended,Great game! Its a extreamly unique game you have traditional survival stuff like food and thirst but you also have stuff unique to Rust such as the Patrol/Attack chopper (There the same thing but people call them both) and supply drops that make for real blood baths! The developers will liston to the community on most changes but as it says in the games description its only early access and alot is broken and will be changed but they have a vison and to trust them. And boy have they delevered! Some people b**** about how there is no single player but when your game is based on pvp and player interaction then why would you have a single player? Also if you looking for a game with friendly people you might want to look some where else because almost everybody in rust has a hidden agenda if they dont kill you on sight then their probably looking to kill you later. The game is great solo but can get stale after a while but if you have even just 1 friend to bounce jokes and gather resourses with it makes the game SOO much more fun. Also if you dont like people stealing your s*** then rust might not for you. People will as we call it Raid you also know as blow into your base and steal your gear and materials. All you have to do is be able to get over losing gear if you do then rust is a great game. Comment if you have any questions and Ill reply as soon as posibleEdit This review was made back in the day. Back in the good times of rust. Back when the game wansn't a full time job. But those days are gone long gone. Now adays to be successful you have to not only play in groups you have to live in your parents basement and play the game 24/7. The way that the devs took the building makes it impossible to build big and if you try your base will become an actual job just to keep from decaying. Then you have the hackers. The people who get hacks kill the whole server for days sometimes even weeks before an admin decides theyre too good to be legit. Like when you get headshot from 1000+ kilometers multiple times by the same person something isnt right yet its just left to happen because... well there isn't an answer to that question. Its just left to happen. With the way the rust devs have taken the game I cant see myself playing it anymore and I DO NOT recommend any of you to. Its a chore and isn't something I find myself wanting to play becasue I have a life I have friends to talk to school work to do sleep to get. I like most people cant afford to play the game for 200 hours plus per two weeks just to get a good base. Its dumb and Im not going to put myself through it anymore. Facepunch yall had a great game and I thank you for the countless hours of fun I had meeting and killing people but this will probably be my final goodbye to this game.

425932,2015-03-09,0,0,208,True,Not Recommended,This is a good game but I don't think this game is great. It has easy and fun crafting methods fun building and raiding /looting. Some people will go as far that they will cheat and hack the game for loot and raid which means they will destroy your built building in impossible ways. While no building is unraidable lesson learned. But when people hack and then fly to the top of and seriously high building and then use millions of explosives to completely obliterate your house which was designed in a spesific way. This kind of destroys this game and makes it pretty bad and frustrating. Yes yes I know this is in alpha but this problem should be fixed above all else in my opinion because this is otherwise a good game. Been playing 70 hours but I don't think I will be playing this game and won't recommend this game to anyone yet until that particular problem is fixed. I don't recommend to buy this game yet until it is hacker unfriendly.,Rust

The fps lag is abrnormally high for a game like this which stops a lot of casual gamers from enjoying it.

425970,2018-06-24,0,0,67,False,Not Recommended,"Summary It's like Minecraft 2 but without singleplay and with super toxic communities on every servers.Graphics and Spec The graphics looks very nice only if the graphics settings are high enough.The graphics is very heavy so you will need a super strong gaming setup. I have a laptop with Intel Core i5 8th Gen (i5 8300H) 8GB ram (One slot) and an SSD (M.2). This setup was enough to run the game on Fantastic settings. Of course the ram is not enough but apperently virtual memory or ""swap"" on the SSD was fast enough for me.I've tried to play this game on Linux but it seems like the game crashes during the asset loading. There was an update but I have not checked on a physical Linux machine.Multiplayer Gameplay Get some friends or play on solo only server (mod) because these ing people are not nice. If you really have to play solo on most servers because you got no friends and/or girl/boy/bothfriend(s) then you must get a microphone to minimize a change of getting randomly killed by s. Some of these s ask you to talk in the game through a microphone before they decide to foot you so having a microphone ready is really important. If you decided to play this game without microphone and/or as a solo you will get foot ed by racists feminists communists socialists animal protesters and neo nazis in about every 10 minutes. Simply don't expect these s to show mercy even if you are not wearing anything and have nothing but a rock and a torch because there are a lot of s who loves to shoot newbs with bolt action rifle from long range.Many servers will completely wipe out on Thursdays so if you are starting new then you should wait till it's thursday and then start playing. Yeah it's kinda sad to let go of your super huge base with tons of guns and because 'Murica but it's somewhat necessary to prevent those clans from completely consume the whole server.Gameplay Overall it's fun but you should expect to do a lot of man labor works. You can literally craft everything but you will also need to collect tons of scraps to get all the blueprints for everything. Goodthing is that you can take a short cut by trying to get some air drops and locked crates however if you are on a highly active server expect to see other players targeting the drop and the crate. That's the other fun part too.It's just so fun to go PvP and stuffs for both sides but raiding someone's base is always fun on one side of course. Good thing is that making traps to prevent raids is also the fun part too you know. Seeing some deceased poor dudes with assault rifles and buncha C4 who got foot ed by your traps is also a lot of fun.",Rust

This game is complete every single person you see will kill you on sight... fresh spawns will run chase you for hours and veterans will waste their ammo on you for no reason at all this game is definitely not meant for solo players as you will find yourself constantly getting ganged on by any and everyone for literally no items a rock and a torch the map feels too small for the amount of players on the servers causing you to run into people very often and again GET KILLED ON SIGHT,Rust

425994,2018-02-03,0,0,256,True,Recommended,This game is crazy. My first time playing I loaded into the game and was immediately murdered by a naked black girl with a rock. I love games that have a decent learning curve with enough opportunity to get going but not too easy. And this game does that. I also like the fact that playing does not allow for you to generate your own character. Like life you are what you are. May seem counter intuitive but I have played games that you could spend an hour getting a new character just right only to find out the playability of the game is boring. So this game flips that on its head. One complaint though is that it takes a long time to load into a game. And I think that when you start loading you are already in the game. I have come across a bunch of people who were just lying there waiting to be murdered (which I was happy to oblige). So there is room for improvement. Also the game supported servers tend to be crowded making newcomers pretty much meat. The upside though is you respawn in a random location if you don't have a sleeping bag to spawn to. SO you can at least respawn away from the last thing person or environmental hazard that killed you.,Rust

426026,2018-01-21,0,0,1454,True,Recommended,After playing rust over a time span of 2 years and sometimes taking month breaks due to bugs and glitches that made the game unplayable I have finally decided to write my review as I think the game is finally in a state that is playable and enjoyable.Most people ask is rust worth the money I say yes rust is only $20 and compared to the price of games these days its pretty cheap theres no in game content in rust and the only thing you could spend your money on is skins and cases.Over the years rust has built up its community and development team and for as long as I can remember there has been an update every week. The developers dont stop there is always new content to explore and new things to do if the game ever gets boring you can just wait untill the new update and have more stuff to do and explore with your friends.Cons my only problems with rust is the insane fps drops and insane lag on rust offical servers if you want to play on a offical server just remember theres gonna be hackers and no admins to stop them theres going to be server lag so if you get angry easily go to community and lastly if you have a laptop dont buy this game.If rust gets there servers under control and hires some admins for the offical servers this game could be even better.Lastly if you want a good fun cheap game to play with your friends get rust just remember if you have a laptop the game will not be playable unless you want to turn your graphics down to 2D.,Rust
426027,2018-01-21,0,0,84,True,Recommended,"Its PVP survival game with awesome base building wall by wall. You will die to random people all the time and lose your stuff. I played Reign of Kings before trying Rust so kinda used to that hardship already. After a few times dieing to a smack talking punk while I was holding alot of resources and loot that took me a long time to gather I really lost interest. Its good short term fun though! Got a good laugh the first hour or two fighting other noobs with rocks. If someone was to make an MMORPG with the same kind of base building mechanisms build castles towns etc it would already be a good game. Unfortunately Rust and Reign of Kings are unfinished free for all PVP ""lose it all"" type games and the special building features are getting lost or perhaps type casted into the genre when they could be really great features to another type of game.",Rust

Devs are focusing cosmetics instead of game breaking things. My old review I am fan of hardcore PVP games and this is one of the best game I ever played. This game shows the primitive nature of modern humans.Attention! This game is not cry baby friendly. You will get killed a lot. You will learn to loose everything you have and live with it. If you play alone (I very recommend to do that dont rush to find team) you will be forced to use your brain to survive hide build plan solo raids scavange scout other players. Community is salty but it's even more fun to beat those salty dudes and make them rage quit hehe. Cheap investment for tons of fun.,Rust

He spawned in as a female and I as a male. So we decided to roleplay and call us ""Hussein"" and ""Fatima"". We raided couple of left over buildings found a nice looking mountain party and decided to build there. It was perfect!Everything was going fine until a group of raiders came by and harrased us. I told them to my wife and leave me alone. Instead they Fatima and killed me Hussein. Looted our house and left it burning.We wanted revenge! Rebuilded and found out where they lived.

I used to be an end game wow raider killing raid bosses in greens and blues early on. This game is poorly conceptualized. Is it a survival game? Nope! PvP Surivival. Encourages group play strongly discourages solo play.Mess up a build cannot unbuild your own structure.New Content released? Total server wipe.This game supposedly came out of EA in Feb. 2018. Don't believe it. This is still a crunchy Beta AT BEST.Gotta scavenge for really anything in game. Ok cool I'm good with that. 99% of the things in the game are cosmetic. Beans on the shelf in the store I'm looting HAHA JK there is one box in the entire store you can loot and it has a single granola bar in it.Game is trash from so many perspectives.

If you arr thinking to buy this game I definetly recommend it and if you are a solo play on solo only servers to make rust life much easier for you.

426068,2018-01-03,0,0,579,False,Recommended,Rust is the best survival game out there. It doesn't only have great looks the gameplay is absolutely amazing. The reason for this is because of how much Facepunch updates their game and how they actually take feedback from the community. Every part of this game is incredible from early game to later in the wipe as the combat evolves from simple bows and spears to heavy weaponry and armour. For some it can be challenging to get started (especially further into map wipes) and most of the random players don't make it easier as they can be toxic at times. Not all players are this way though I've ran into many helpful people.,Rust

Creating a base is one thing you can choose to do or you and some other player can create massive walls around many houses. Create almost kingdom like bases. Create allies or enemys and hunt them all them out. Rule over the whole server or make a cave base and hide from society. There is many things to do in this game and this game gets updated literally every thursday so there is never a lack of content in the game as it gets updated so much. This game is well worth your $20 as long as your start of on a community server is not many people playing then as your skills get better switch to official.,Rust

426104,2014-07-01,0,0,4,True,Recommended,Rust is a fun game for people that are a fan of Minecraft. It is a survival game where you have to survive along with other people on a multiplayer server.(Yes it is MULTIPLAYER ONLY as of right now) It does have the same collect and craft as minecraft but there's alot of other stuff like guns and clothes and things. But because it is only multiplayer it is hard for noobs or people who aren't that great at first person shooters because everybody just kills you the second they get the chance. It also has a few bugs too. Like it gets a little laggy sometimes even on a beefy computer but it is early aplpha and they update it pretty frequently so play at your own risk. I would recommend it though it just depends on who is playing it.,Rust

I am NOT giving this game a bad review I am only stating that it doesn't run well on older low end PCs. So those who don't have at least a quad core don't even try this game.

Most players are under the age of 18 and kill you on sight without saying a word. The ""Survival"" game is played like some sort of call of duty game running around shooting everything that moves. Takes away from the whole purpose the developers have said the game strives on surivival. Of course PVP is inevitable but to play the game just to kill people just kills the game as a result. Potential to be one of the best survival online games ever but limited by young kids and limited minds who act like literal neanderthals. It's to be expected but not at such a large scale and percentage. Very interesting to be honest from a psychological stand point intriguing.

426142,2016-04-24,0,0,31,True,Not Recommended,This is a game like many other survivor pvp games. You start with nothing and have to gather materials to make a base. The combat is decent definitely has room to grow in terms of controls hit reg and balancing. You can make a decent base with the materials you gather in the world as well as hunt to feed yourself if you manage to live long enough. For higher leveled tools/weapons/armour you need to gather what are called blueprints to reveal the crafting recipe.Here are the problems You start with only a rock and a torch the torch may as well be useless the light is too low to be useful and you don't exactly want people to know where you are. There are many servers to play on you DO NOT want to play on a populated server you WILL DIE many times. People will not hesitate to gun you down repeatedly. I have not had a situation where I saw someone with a gun not kill someone and 90% of the time they know they get nothing from it. Players will camp the sites where blueprints spawn with the best gear kill on the beaches where you spawn most of the time. The way the game sets it up requires you to play at the very start of a server after the wipe or have a clan. You cannot be successful on your own on a server with more than 50 people.Do not expect a single person to help you. Even if you ask in the chat in the many servers I asked new player questions to see the responses most of the top players of the servers would rather insult and flame the new players rather than help someone in the slightest way. The community has no dignity they will kill you trust means nothing no one owes you anything for anything you do.Developers if you are reading this your game needs to have something you can earn preferrably crafting recipes rather than having all comodities be able to be camped hoarded and trolled. As well as guns are far too common it simply makes it easier for people who know what they are doing to kill new players. This puts off anyone who has a small interest in the game and for those who have higher interests in the game follow suit when they finally get a gun.,Rust
426143,2016-04-24,0,0,48,True,Not Recommended,Well made in many respects and improved lots since earlier version but too many annnoying things arm the moments. if you had a large group of friends on it would be fun but for every one else expect to die many times and expect to have your base destroyed many times especially with the helicopter which patrols key locations and if you build a base too close it will destroy your base in seconds.,Rust

Having a few friends in this game is a real advantage over a solo player game is very demanding as not gathering resources is not an option.Monthly wipes of maps make level the playing field so that new spawns also get a chance having a friendly server also help learning the game.So advice to new players find a PVE server and watch YouTube for advice on bases.

426193,2017-06-28,0,0,50,True,Recommended,community is toxic but game is good. completely depends on the server you play on however. you might spend hours building a base only to have it destroyed or die 10 times as soon as you spawn because this game is extremely PVP oriented. you can also have your base destroyed and your body looted even if you're offline. so I'd only recommend this if you are not prone to rage quitting and can deal with the community. its not exactly based on survival as much as it should be instead it is more focused on PVP and killing people. however there are good servers out there with good communities so not everyone is toxic. stuff like towns aren't as common as they may seem. component system for Rust does need a rework as it is not balanced at the moment.,Rust

I had next to no idea what I was meant to be doing but I had a rock and three meters. I spawned in at night on a small beach so I instantly began to freeze and lost a bit of health. Following the coastline I found many houses (in hindsight they were all probably abandoned) and pilfered some pumpkins and corn from a small crop field. I then immediately hightailed it to the mountains and began cutting down some trees for wood. After about 45 minutes of running around and trying to figure out how to cook food I died of food poisoning from stolen food after starving and drinking salty water.Spawn back in again and this time I go straight to looking for food. I found some mushrooms but I guess they belonged to a guy as he shot me with an arrow. I managed to hide inside a bush but I spent the next ten minutes hiding inside of it thinking he was still there until I poked my head out and found out it was a horse. Didn't find any food but I found a player idling on the beach. Died of starvation.This time I went inland. There were a lot of gunshots in the distance and people getting angry over someone cheating. I got shot in the back by a guy with a bow who then apologized thinking that I was a threat and let me go. For whatever reason I thought it would be a good idea to run towards the gunshots. Got scared and hid in another bush. I slowly snuck inside an empty house and took my bearing. Killed a horse (first kill!) and ate it over a fire in the empty shack. I then got out of the warzone and headed towards the beach. I was still pretty hungry so I needed to get some food. After following the beach for some time I found and killed a wild boar who happily dropped four pork for me enough to sustain me for a long time. After chasing down another boar a man saw me shot me berated me for my sloppy fighting (despite never really ever fighting before) and then murdered me with my own spear.I joined a new server (my dignity was low but spirits still high) and went exploring the forests. The people here (if there were people) were a bit more friendly keeping their distance from me. I actually managed to make myself a bow 100 arrows and a burlap suit. But food was another story. I searched every forest and valley for food and all I could find was the occasional mushroom. No deer horse or boar to be seen. I pilfered another pumpkin farm and set to work building a base only to be suprise attacked by a bear and killed. I did build a sleeping bag this time but the bear just turned around and immediately killed me again anyway.After 3 hours 4 or so deaths and 6 or so kills I think I'm done for the moment. This game is fun but I don't think I can get too invested in it what with all the raiding and such.",Rust

426222,2013-12-23,0,0,483,True,Recommended,EDIT You can read my original review from December of 2013 below the line.It has now almost been 4 years since I got Rust and wrote my review on it. I remember when the game first came out the idea was generic yet ambitious since the guy behind the game is the same guy that made Garry's Mod. People weren't sure what to expect but were hopeful for the most part. Boy has the game changed from what it once was. Rust used to have zombies and radiation infected animals now it has a player base. The game is so much more detailed and thorough than any other survival game out on the market at the moment. It blends base building PVP interactions and hardcore survival against the elements (mostly when you're a freshspawn) into a nice little bundle of absolute frustration. Oh and it doesn't even stop there. If you're fortunate enough to build up a decent base you now have other players to worry about. Raiding is one of the most heavy aspects of Rust invading other bases and taking the spoils for yourself. Unfortunately most raids are offline but if you get the opportunity to defend your base while both parties are online it is one hell of a rush. If vanilla Rust (Rust without modifications to the game settings) then perhaps modded and community servers are more your type of thing. Most modded and community servers tend to have tweaks and modifications to the base game in order to create a less grueling experience. For example if you decided to get the game for you and your friend but always fail to find each other on the map modded servers grant the power of teleporting to your friends. Another popular attraction of modded servers are the increased gather rates of resources. 2x 3x 4x 5x and so forth are the increased rates at which you would normally receive resources in vanilla Rust. It makes for a more enjoyable experience if you didn't join the server at the beginning of the wipe. Overall Rust is a pretty fun game but it is in Early Access which means the game is inclined to having bugs crashing freezing etc.. If you're willing to bear through such things and acknowledge that the game is still in Early Access then you should have an enjoyable experience. Completely disregard what anyone has says about Rust still being in Early Access. You have to keep in mind that the development team behind Rust is extremely small compared to the say the development team behind H1Z1. Considering how much the game has done within the year it has been in Early Access then they have come pretty far. They've fixed their fair share of bugs and they've completely updated the look of Rust in the most recent months. You also have to keep in mind that Garry also has other things to work on and doesn't have a team that is literally dedicating their entire lives to developing Rust. In my honest opinion this game has an extremely positive future and you should buy it now while it's still $20 and before it rises in price.,Rust

426224,2017-06-28,0,0,183,True,Recommended,I have played just about every early access survival game there is. Previously I had vouched for DayZ for years saying it has the potential to be the best game ever made and all the hate was unfair blah blah blah. When I finally purchased Rust I was completely shocked with how much fun it actually was. DayZ ARK H1Z1 the forest etc. Can't compare to how well put together (relatively speaking) Rust is. For the genre at this point in time it is hands down the best game to play. At the cheapest price point (I believe) It is much more fun Runs much better Has better building. The only aspect of the game that is rivaled is PVE and ARK wins in that field but I wouldn't say to the degree that it even competes overall. At the end of the day I would say Rust is well worth the 10 20 dollars and it still receives consistent (FREE) updates.,Rust

426236,2015-05-18,0,0,47,True,Not Recommended,Okay i will try to summorize my experience with this game so far. You start at a beach with A stone and a torch and immediately you're faced against people with guns spears bows and other stuff. They kill you so they can eat you that's a thing now. When you by some miracle manages to get past them you have to use your stone to gather resources. when you got enoguh resources you build a hatch (takes 2 min) and then someone kills you. then you do that all over again and manages to stay alive for over 5 min. After you've collected a bunch of wood you run around looking for stones once again you die. when you've managed to find wood and stones you start building your base. immediately some s with a bow come and ruins your house. they break each wall in 1 shot and then they kill you. When you actually have a house some food and some other resources you either start looking for friends or try to find barrels so you can get blueprints. you'll get one every 15 barrel or something and they will mostly be useless. If you find a friend he will straight up murder you the sec you turn your back and then proceed to mutilate you. if you by any chance do find someone that isnt a blodthirsty he will have friends that s everything up and by the end gets you and everyone killed by inviting every naked man he sees to your home. After you've collected a few more resources and killed a couple naked guys just to get your revenge you log off thinking it was worth it. the next time you log in some s have stolen your base and everything you had. you spawn back at the beach and get spawn killed and all you have to show for it is some blueprints that teaches you how to make shoes. this is my experience and it took me about a day (IRL) to do everything and now all i got is some blueprints that suck balls cuz you wont find any animals so you wont be able to craft any clothes and when you finally do find some animals they use their noclip to walk through rocks and their super speed to outrun you. To make a bow you need cloth and the only thing you can kill without a bow is either wolfs or pigs. both of witch are rare as . once now and then a air drop will drop things right next to your house so people will come guns and bows blazing shooting each other and then taking a giant dump on your house. If you try to go for a airdrop you will get anally by people with AK47. They have a cold system now also and at night you will die from freezing unless you make a fire and if you do make a fire you will get hunted and killed by people with weapons etc. you cant defend yourself from them all you can do is bend over and take it. and forget about running if you encounter a small hill you're ed. Hills slow you down with 80% or something. I would rather suffocate on a balloon then play this game again it gives you nothing and then they steal it from you. Kicking yourself in the nuts is more fun than this game,Rust
426237,2018-07-02,0,0,136,False,Recommended,Ya know I'm going to be honest. This is a really good game though a few stuff here and there needs to be worked out with an example being the loading time to get in. though it really depends. Like for example if you get one during the weekend your going to have a long load time getting on but on weekdays i've found it to be a lot more faster though it really just depends. when it comes to the gameplay I would say its great though when looking at the mininum requirements I would say to get a little more stronger stuff for no lag but if your find messing with the settings in the game it can be worked out. Now when it comes to the players they can be toxic but its really just a hit or miss because i've ment a good few thats just past to say a hi and a ho even the experienced but it can be better to just be wary. So if you have the patience for a long load time here and there and are fine messing with the settings so its not so lagy and are fine sometimes getting killed by toxic players then I think the game will be really fun for you though if not still try it out cause you still may like it the game is really good its just going over a rough patch right now.,Rust

The survival aspect is only slightly difficult within the first 5 mins it's basically a fps but with a loot system.

Yet somehow VAC and facepunch didn't detect when one of them jumped so high he came up from beneath us and shot us in our respawns.literally in less than 3 minutes I was killed over 8 times along with all of my friends.

Also you have the animals. The Bears Wolves and other players are your real enemy so watch out. A recommendation for you noobs just starting out add variety in your servers.

I love minecraft this is like a cheap Xbox Live $1 game that knocks it off but with guns so people just act like a 13 year old at a Beiber concert. This had such potential primitive weapons only and more variety would be amazing. A game that looks this good should have crafting on the FTB level and just more overall. It's a flat experience that doesn't have much of a serious peak to it at any point. As many bugs as DayZ has and so many stupid things in it it's still fun as hell...,Rust

426329,2017-10-22,0,0,449,True,Recommended,I play this game at least 6 hours a week and its is SO FUN. But there are some things you have to accept for example people in this game are the saltist people ever. You gonna spawn into a server a think pkay lets get a base going so you do and you get everything you need to ger going then a few fully geared people with Ak 47s and armor will raid your little 1x1 hut. To get full enjoyment out of this game for me is to play it with friends and if you don't have friends find people online. That will help so much. People also ask whats the point of Gathering and Building if it just wipes in a week. For me it trying to control the server before it wipes be the best clan in the server. Anyway Idk if this was helpful at all but the game is enjoyable if you have a group of 2+ people.,Rust

His scatter brained development process introduces things into the game just because he feels like it. So called features left to be untouched for months even years. The game's population fluctuates frequently because Helk changes his mind every 3 4 months. Claims the previous systems introduced were inferior when he never takes any time to balance anything. Listens to the shills of the loudest player base and cater's to their play style. Don't bother with this game because it will never be finished. Helk will decide something isn't perfect remove it and replace with some thoughtless idea he came up with while browsing reddit on the toilet...The final nail in the coffin is he uses Twitter to troll his player base promising features that should be implemented but never will...Just Remember the History of his Incompetence Stairs still don't line up with Doors and the stairs only face one direction and can't be mirrored.You're defenseless if you lose your rock you can't punch or anything...a game without punching made by a company called ""Face Punch"" Melee Combat is a ing joke.A spear costs a whole tree.....you need a workbench to craft a stone spear... A spear is a simple weapon made from a long piece of wood... how does that equate to a whole tree? you find a stick and sharpen it... i feel spears should be a more accessible weapon not spend 15 minutes chopping a tree down and another 3 minutes crafting a damn spear..Most Loot you get from barrels and boxes are utter trash Blue Prints that are purely cosmetic or for Role Players... Yeah I definitely enjoy risking my life to gather mailbox blueprints and bear rugs...You can't even remodel your own base if you mess up you are stuck with it. Sure you can destroy objects but only within the time limit.The Survival aspect is a joke. Thirst and Hunger really have no effect on the gameplay. you can practially bandage through the damage..You shouldn't be able to abuse the healing mechanics in the game spamming Bandages and Medical Syringes just makes the game feel like who ever has the most Medical Supplies automatically wins the battle. Also why have Large Medkits if no one uses them?The Game is just mindless PVP now no objectives or endgame.. its like a Free For All where you have to build all your gear just to lose it to someone who is better geared than you.They couldn't even hatch up some Bounty system that rewards players for killing someone thats been on a kill streak etc. The are no incentives for peaceful interactions in this game. If only they added a safe zone where everyone could come and trade and pick up bounties from a bullentin board. I dunno something more engaging than...

426391,2018-03-21,0,0,333,False,Recommended,So much to say though I will try to be as brief as possible for people who just want a quick review. I've been tracking on this game since it's release in 2013 and yet the community that supports the development of this game is still going strong. It's games like these that make the market because they keep the player coming back for more experiences and more memories within the game. It's release from early access should definitely increase that player base in the future as well. The progress that has been made on this game is outstanding. Since the first version of it in 2013 the development team made canyons wide leaps in making this game look as beautiful as it does in it's current state. They also engage their community and ask them what they'd be interested in seeing in the game both in mechanics and in content. These ideas aren't ignored either and the development team really does consider any really good ideas. Easily the most fun 333.9 hours I've spent in a game. I usually choose server populations of around 15 or 20 to get a good start solo which is what I usually play as. On servers with more than 50 it can be a little suffocating and difficult to get anything done as a solo player however it's these servers that maximize the most on the competitive side of Rust. Let me give you a rundown of my kind of typical day on a modded server on Rust you spawn in gather your resources and you choose a spot that's safe enough to build in. With low pop servers you'll occasionally run into a fellow naked or sometimes stumble upon an active base but for the most part I avoid areas with a high player concentration. Once your base is up and running you begin the ambiguous process of upgrading. This is where the fun begins because you're not technically just focusing on upgrading but also improving upon your knowledge of the server where the best guys are how much stuff (bases people etc) is around the map where the radtowns are etc etc. This process is also a great time to make friends join clans participate in raids and destroy other peoples livelihoods within the server (lol). While doing this it goes without saying that you will also run the risk of being raided yourself and once that happens all you do then is just dust yourself off and repeat from step one. It can get frustrating at times but it can keep you coming back again and again. While playing I've also met some very interesting people within the servers some of whom I still talk to and play with today. It's these social encounters within Rust that give it it's amusing quality because in real life unless you're living in a nudist colony where men in bucket helmets shoot at you on a daily basis you don't expect someone to come up to you brandishing their testicles and shouting an incomprehensible mixture of memes and gibberish. On top of that the ragdoll effect within the game makes for some interesting death scenes. Overall this game has been a great purchase and has given me many memorable moments to look back on as a gamer. I encourage anyone interested to pick up this game as it will undoubtedly give you the same experience and quite possible more. With an open ended game like Rust anything you think of doing can be done.,Rust
426392,2018-03-21,0,0,369,False,Recommended,This game is brutal but fun. The more hours you spend learning the more payoff for the first 100 hrs then it's just luck and what you want out of it. The PVE seems to be improving. PVP is still fun but critical to the server you choose. I recommend trying multiple servers from the start. It will help you get acclimated with the map and the different types of players.Overall a must try. Worth every penny and fun to play with friends.,Rust

This game will never be a good experiance for new players like myself and caters only to those who have played since it first entered early access. Nobody cares to help out new players.

The game went from being a trend setter to ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" through literally hundreds of developer updates. By the time this game is finished I predict most of the player base will have moved on.For me I won't be playing anymore because I can't stand the 10+ minute load times constant wiping of maps due to performance issues and ever changing strategies required to play this game. On the off chance I find a fun group to play with it can be fun but right now it's way more entertaining to just watch popular streamers play the game.",Rust

426403,2015-01-02,0,0,240,True,Recommended,Love how high you are allowed to create buildings and structures and the fact you can build on bodies of water! Once you learn the controls and kit and teleport commands the world is your oyster. Hopefully you get on a server with helpful people or play with friends. You need friends in a game like this otherwise you better be careful how much you player kill or karma will come back bigtime. Some of the pitfalls (at least to some) are you cannot dig underground the zombies are gone in rust (not sure about legacy people can and will break into your base kill you and take your stuff (happens often if you do not fortify) gathering is tedious if not on an excess gather server and gathering supplies in the dark is downright dangerous because you cant see the bears and wolves until its too late. Still for all its faults Rust is a great game highly addicting and time consuming. Many of the things which make it most annoying are also its best attributes you have to build elaborate bases dummy bases sniper towers and use friends to keep from being raided. Learning HOW to outsmart the other players is half the battle.,Rust

426436,2013-12-16,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Game is fairly challenging and enjoyable. Community is a mixed bag. Some people seemed fairly relaxed and friendly some people were not. I'd imagine that will sway either way as the game develops. Would love to see a party system because the only way you can find your friends is by sheer dumb luck. Also it is likely just my bad luck but the animal spawning is rediculously low making food very hard to come by. Bushes with berries would be an awesome addition to counter this if anyone else is having problems. Overall do recommend trying or at least keeping an eye on as it moves through alpha ),Rust

426475,2017-10-13,0,0,571,True,Recommended,I ONLY have 500 hours in RUST so not as many as some. It is a very rewarding game but can also be hard. If your the type of player that longs for an adrenaline rush Rust can most certainly give that but it can be frustrating when you are trying to get set up and keep getting killed by people with better guns big bases or a large group of players working together. The game is amazingly fun with friends and some of fondest gaming memories are when we had a group of 5 6 RL friends and built a large base to defend. It is a very hard game solo but not un enjoyable you will just need to invest a lot of time to enjoy it that way.The devs are constantly reworking major systems in order to try and accentuate the best parts of Rust which doesn't always work but the new updates seem like a step in the right direction.Rust is at it's best during an intense bow fight a feud with your neighbour or 2+ real life friends trying to stake a claim on a server. It's visceral intense and sometimes frustrating but it can be very rewarding. The graphics and base building are also great.,Rust
426476,2017-10-13,0,0,739,True,Recommended,After a decent amount of hours on the game I can highly recommend it to anyone thinking about jumping on board. While some vocal members of the community are outraged by the balancing taking place as of now (FYI both major and minor updates occur on a weekly basis which always makes the game refreshing to play) I would gladly say that it is heading in a direction that promotes a game in which all can enjoy not just zergs. This game is harsh. It always will be harsh. It's one of the most survival esque survival games I've ever played. But don't let that discourage you. The fun is in the brutality of it which sees regular players turn into immoral monsters as you forge friendships and hatreds in a game where you do all you can to both survive and dominate.,Rust

426499,2017-10-13,0,0,1234,True,Recommended,Been playing Rust for about 4 years now. When the game came out it was truly a one of a kind experience and the market quickly populated with games that emulated certain aspects of Rust. While it could be argued that DayZ was the originator of this genre I would argue that Rust innovated enough with base building and brought much more depth to player interaction. But the question at hand isn't whether Rust is historically relevant in the gaming world. It's whether Rust is a good game or not. While I might claim that this game sucks when I'm angry it also has brought me a lot of joy. I've met some people in the game that I've gone on to play other games with too. The daily life of Rust can be sometimes frustrating but thats what's amazing about the game. It lends itself to large amounts of randomness and unpredictabilitly.Buy Rust. Play it. It's never too late to get started tbh.,Rust

426501,2017-10-13,0,0,314,True,Recommended,While Rust is an early access game the developers and designers are constantly making updates and changes not only to the functionality of the gameplay but to the graphics and perfomance as well. While the constant updating can be an upside to the EA norm of getting greenlit and then never touching your game again the updates have also been a headache to those that loved the game at a specific stage of development and would rather it not change.It's a fun game with a really fun premise of survival and base building. PvP is constantly being tweaked and PvE is having its ups and downs as well. If you get this game don't settle in for how it is at any given point and expect things to change from week to week each Thursday.I would recommend this game to anyone that likes PvP survival games with crafting and building elements. I would not recommend this game to anyone wanting a finished game that won't change. Please believe me when I say this game will change. The hings you love may be deprecated while the things you hate may be promoted.,Rust
426502,2017-10-13,0,0,190,True,Recommended,Rust is a game of patience and persistence and you experience that the moment you start the game and that turns a lot of people off. As of recently updates have been kiling the game but I have hope for this wonderful game. This game attracts the player who enjoys sitting down and grinding and having their work pay off (most of the time) but it also attracts cucks so watch out. I reccomend playing this game with a veteran if you're new but once you get the ist I reccomend playing solo to better understand the game. Overall I rate this game 7/10.,Rust

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",Rust

The base I had made by then was armored the outside was honey combed and the roof was covered in those metal barbed wire barricades so people couldn't uild up the walls or get on the roof.The fort's base was something like 6 by 6 maybe more.

426560,2017-08-14,0,0,310,True,Recommended,I think i've had enough playtime to justify a review. This game is incredibly fun especially if you're playing with other people or friends. You get into the routine of starting over so much that eventually you get completely used to it you also realise that only 1/100000 people are geniunely friendly in Rust but when you find the odd friendly player you can have some great fun. Base building is very solid if you have a small team of players you can make some huge bases that last a long time (a long time in Rust is probably more than a day without being raided) likewise raiding is just as fun although you have to grind a lot to get the bombs/rockets/guns (at least on non op vanilla ish servers). You also die a lot in Rust if I haven't mentioned already here are some fun ways to die Get killed when you are a naked (freshspawn) most common. you get used to it Get raided online and die whilst witnessing your hours of work put into your base gone probably most depressing Get killed on the way to a raid very annoying Get killed by abusive admins there are more than you think! Get killed while raiding a base annoying if you have good loot Getting killed by a wolf once one locks on to you you are ed ) Getting doorcamped definately very annoying Realising the server has been wiped just after you made your gigantic mega fortress base it'l put you off Rust for a while hahaThis game I definately think is more fun with friends or other people although it is definately still fun by yourself but I only really fine myself playing it when a friend is on etc. There are regular updates which add some cool content and it definately feels like a finished game already despite the many years it has been in Early Access. Probably the most hours i've put into a game in my Steam Libary.,Rust

426566,2018-01-02,0,0,229,True,Recommended,"I have only played 24 hours so far in Rust but they have been fun filled and exciting! I watched a few tutorial vids before starting and used some recommendations and advice to choose a suitable community server before starting out. Go for one that isn't super packed and you stand a good chance of avoiding the spawn killing chaos that so many people rage about. A couple of highlights from my time so far I woke up on the beach with no idea where I was and a guy runs up to me with his buddy. Rather than slashing me down with a sword he pulled out an acoustic guitar and played a song for me whilst I jumped up and down naked in a desperate attempt to play along and not be killed on the spot! I built my starter base with an airlock type entrance as advised and I hear people outside. I hear them knocking on the door as I try to make as little noise as possible in the hope they'll just leave. Time goes by and I realise that I cannot wait them out. I think ""hey I've only started what have I got to lose?!"" and open the doors with spear in hand. By mere luck I manage to head shot both with my wooden spears as they peeked into the open doorway. In any other game this would be nothing but Rust makes it mean so much!So many people bash this game for poor community aspects. In my experience so far I think I have played the Rust that the developers intend. IT IS GLORIOUS.

426612,2015-08-28,0,0,86,True,Not Recommended,In all honesty unless you know how to get aimbots or whatever you won't get very far in this game. The game itself super cool. The whole surviving stuff is pretty fun. However as with many games the players are what completely ruin the game. Finding another player that will actually work with you or just simply not kill you is especially hard to do in this game. Here is a breakdown of a Rust experience.Wake up on a beach naked. You have a rock and a torch and that is it. You use your rock to get wood make yourself a spear. Find some cloth make yourself some clothes. See another player running towards you. They might be friendly you are obviously a freshly spawned person who has close to nothing and for sure have nothing they need judging from their fully armored body and the AK 47 they are carrying. You give a pleasant hello and start to ask Dead.They shot you. Why? Because you are playing Rust at the same time they are and they found you. So unless you literally play this game non stop for days on end play unfairly or have three other friends that play with you you most likely will not have a good time playing this game.,Rust

I thought it would be a minecraft style game mixed in with PUBG. Boy was i mistaken.First 5 minutes of playing i got blasted with a shotgun. Then a crowbow then a shotty again. I figured wow i cant wait til I can craft those.I never did. Begining in RUST is IMPOSSIBLE unless you have friends or you hide on the outskirts of everything where resources are even more scarce more wild animals can decimate you and you base is widely out of place making it a target for raids.After 3 days of running around getting materials and avoiding fights i had a solid Metal base 3 layers thick with multiple doors and i thought ""Now i can rest and start working on guns and other protections over the next few days."" So i signed off and went to bed. Woke up the next day and my base was gone. All my items were gone but the other 2 bases near me were fine... Thats Rust in a nutshell.Dont have friends who play? Dont get Rust.Dont have 8+ hours to devote to a game per day? Dont get Rust.Dont like running around naked and getting shot at? Dont get Rust.Its not a BAD game its just way too difficult for what it should be this game shouldnt be a full time job.

426632,2015-01-11,0,0,253,True,Recommended,"Edit 08/29/2015 Okay so I thought I would give this game another whirl seeing as how a lot of the reviews have gone from negative to positive. I fired it back up and it is a fantastic game now. The graphics are stunning and there is finally no more wild hacking being done. They have changed the crafting system as well as quantity of resources. I am happy to say that this game is once again fantastic and I look forward to playing it a lot. Changed from not recommened to definitely recommended.**** DO NOT BUY****Okay so at first this game had A LOT of promise. There were days I really looked forward to playing the game after work and seeing all the funny fights between naked dudes with rocks. Now though.... It's different. There is so much hacking and cheating it is unreal. They have programs online where you can pay like $20 a month and be able to do pretty much anything. I watched a friend use it once and he could press like F5 and everybody on the map would pop up with a box around them. Then he could press F2 and kill them from anywhere on the map then pretty much fly to where that guy was at and steal all of his stuff he had on him. He also had infinite C4's which was ridiculous. Graphics wise I can't really complain. For being an Alpha game the graphics are actually really nice looking once you turn it to the ""Beautiful"" setting. Fires looked great as well as pretty much everything else.I just miss the days of night trolling. Nights on here get dark. Like REALLY dark. At times when it was night I would go around and try to creep people out. The way voice chat works on the game is if you're really far you're barely audible. But if you're close you can hear the other person just fine. So I would go around to these run down shacks where I knew somebody was at due to like a campfire and maybe the people inside talking to themselves. At that point I would keep my distance and play ""Tiptoe through the Tulips"" by Weird Al. People would stop talking and immediately extenguish the fire and run out with just a gun to kill whoever was doing it. But now I can't do that thanks to the hackers. Now I just get killed by a hack as soon as I start (3/10 Will not be playing again. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME",Rust

426668,2017-09-19,0,0,1097,True,Not Recommended,The game is on sell at the moment right now people because they're trying to get a final cash grab in before they drop the ball. They've had plenty of opportunities to optimize the game for multiple system setups so that more than just a few people can enjoy the experience of rust. Unless you're running a specific setup with a specific set of drivers.. expect memory leaks and fps drops like crazy. They aren't focusing on this issue either they are pushing out more money grabbing with skins. But what they don't realize is the community will slowly die if the game continues to become more and more unplayable. Don't buy and waste your breath until they show they've fixed it. Keep watch and once they fix it I encourage others to join cause it is fun otherwise. But fun is only when it's playable.,Rust

426674,2015-02-18,0,0,500,False,Recommended,What's the objective in Rust? For most people in Rust it's establishing a base that you can defend while you learn new technologies and advanced from a rocket wielding naked to a fully geared killing machine.There are multiple roles you can take in your group. You can hunt people and steal whatever they are carrying you can harvest resources raid bases explore monuments or be the dedicated builder in your group.There are many sandbox elements in this game which allow for a lot of creativity. You can chat up your neighbors and try to form an alliance but can you ever really trust them?Cons The biggest problem in rust is unbalanced mega clans. The team that has the largest number of player hours to spend dominates every time. You have no chance if you play solo. This could be fixed by implimenting something like factions in game but there's nothing on their current road map to address it.The meta game. If you want to optimize your chance of not being raided you need to build specific base designs. Being creative will give you a good chance of being raided.,Rust
426675,2015-05-28,0,0,765,False,Recommended,Rust is a hardcore survival game with a heavy focus of player interaction and raiding. The game revolves around talking to people and forming different types of relationships whether good or bad. These relationships alter the way you play and can dictate whether you are peaceful to your neighbors or wild savages that become their worst nightmares.Everything in this game is nerve racking and tense regardless of how many hours you have under your belt. I find myself feeling the same emotions the same fear the same rush the same nerve racking tension that I felt when I first got the game and it doesn't get old. The game feels ruthless and the more you play the more you see your own ruthless tendencies.Other than blade or gun fights the game allows you to raid your enemies. Building a base is a must as you're going to need a place to stash your goods. At any point with enough materials you can attack a rival's base bombarding it with explosives. Raiding becomes a game of strategy in which the defender must use their base and its layout to take down any attackers or at least outsmart them and run them dry of firepower. Regardless of the results of a raid it's an intense feeling being part of one and the rush alone is worth it.Facepunch the developers of the game have shown an extreme dedication to the game. They push regular content updates harsher anti cheat and quality of life improvements. These arrive monthly and throughout the game's early access development have always given us a reason to keep playing.Lastly Rust isn't for everyone. It's a very harsh toxic and blood thirsty world full of savages ready to spear you down in an instant. If you can handle it Rust can offer small rays of hope in a dark desolate place. Small towns are sometimes formed trading posts bustle with industrial product and sometimes you meet people that stick it through the thick and thin with you.I highly recommend Rust for one reason alone. The bonds you create with others within the game aren't like those in any other. It's an experience you must try for yourself to understand. It's not easy to survive but when you do and you do it with others it becomes a whole different game.,Rust

The adrenaline can get going playing this game! I highly recommend you play with friends so that you can communicate work together and experience the incredibly detailed world together.

426696,2017-08-27,0,0,358,True,Recommended,"Update 11/30/2017I really like this game it's not a bad survival type of game and it functions pretty well.But this game probably has the most toxic player base I've ever encountered. Now of course in PvP you're going to die here and there that is a given. But between hate mongering and people who act to almost cruel degrees it makes this game extremely difficult to enjoy.Example Get shot by player I'm annoyed and ask if he can at least not kill me. He picks me up gives me back the resources he looted off me and says he's ""sorry."" No more than a couple seconds later he puts an arrow through my head and laughs. Another game where people calling themselves ""pirates"" somehow changed all my door locks in less than one minute which only increases my loathing for PvP gameplay. Along with this one thing I've noticed a high amount of people in this game act rather immature and do everything ranging from idle threats acting profane and being plain rude. Most of all though I do understand it almost all players are kill on sight no questions asked even when your fresh off the beach nude and armed only with a torch and a rock while they're sporting an assault rifle.But of course there are plenty of people who can be very friendly. Though most are located within the PvE servers and seem rare to find in the PvP aside from people who run hotels. But most friendly people will express a healthy cautiousness of other players they don't know KoS doesn't apply to that group.As for the game itself. The graphics look pretty good. Nothing mind blowing but things like lighting and shadows are fairly well don and textures remain consistant thoughout. Plenty of graphics options to get things tuned to your likeing which is always a plus. Though some textures or actions look a little weird here and there the game is still receiving updates so this is a plus as well.Gameplay feels pretty solid. Though a bit grindy depending on what your doing or what server your in. But there's a great range of servers to choose from. Everything from battle royals high resource count servers which create a battle that spans the island roleplay and PvE servers and a few others with their own additions in the modded servers.All in all I really like this game but a majority of the player base are incredibly immature and it appears that majority are in their teens. The only other game I have to compare the player base too is GTA Online. People just being rude and thinking ruining others experiences are fun when their just out trolling. So honestly my recommendation is a soft yes but a yes no less. But this game isn't for people who are tempermental.I will say I'm done with this game for the time being. Far too many hackers. Between changing the locks on metal doors in thirty seconds aim bots and fly hacks I'm honestly done.Update 11/30/2017 The hacking situation is getting worse servers are dying faster. Game is becoming a bit more balanced and sharper looking. But I have to say something very specific about this game well it's advert on it's Steam store page. It's lies. You're first day in Rust will not be peaceful. The first few minutes will not be peaceful. It's trailer should show you waking on the beach cutting some wood and then suddenly it cuts to a fully geared individual running down the beach with an automatic weapon mowing down naked people while making inhuman noises into their microphone. That is all for this update.",Rust

However new players need to go into this game with a certain mindset.Gameplay Players need to be able to commit multiple hours to a play session. trying to play for 30 minutes at a time will get you nowhere fast. You will have setbacks in this game and will almost certainly be killed multiple times or have your base demolished before you figure out how to survive for longer periods of time but that is the point of this game. To Figure out how to survive. While you can play this game solo it is 10x more fun to play with friends or have a clan. This makes it harder for you to get greifed and a overall better experience as playing solo will get very lonely the majority of the time as pretty much every random player you meet will try to kill you on sight.Development This game has received major overhauls and is currently recieving major updates on a weekly basis. The devs listen to community feedback and have an overall great commitment to getting this game out of early access and into a full game status. This game is probably the single greatest example of a early access developed game as most other titles have lost dev support or ended up bascialy being scams.10/10 Would recommend to anyone who loves FPS Survival or teambased games.,Rust

Eventually I managed to make a little base and sleeping bag thinking I was then safe.Wrong again.Whilst finally getting a furnace and starting to produce some metal fragments a guy shoots down my wooden door kills me destroys my bed and loots / destroys everything.I would never again ask anybody to get this game it's seemingly an output for anger for experienced players as they constantly taunt you and attempt to upset you in any way they can imagine.Never thought I'd find a game I'd sincerely think was bad to this extent but here we are.,Rust

426788,2017-12-05,0,0,85,True,Not Recommended,Used to be so much more fun. With the introduction of all the new elements it really is just not the Rust that people had come to love. I would say that the blueprints are its biggest downfall. Now if you want to make anything in the game you must either get blueprints through random drops or pay heavy amounts of scrap for. It was a bit of a grind before but now the grind fest is just too much. I really hope they take away the blueprints. That would bring me back to this game. But for now I really do not see any point in continuing with the game in this state. Or maybe if they were to release an old version too before all these updates that would be really cool. They tried upgrading the game but just ended up downgrading it. Really sad.,Rust

426791,2017-02-18,0,0,930,True,Recommended,I love this game it is my favorite game. The graphics are great the community is but thats ok. It is hard as a solo player but a lot easier with another person. not everybody is a i have gone outside my base and made friends with man people. Some guy and his group raided me as a solo plaer and now we are pretty much best friends. I say all you have to do is make friends and you will be fine. I recomend this game to everybody. I think it is a great game with huge potential. EDITED VERSION Current version of Rust is still a lot of fun but for me where I don't have much time to play a game it is very hard. The blueprint system they added makes the game more grindy. You have to play for a very long time to get things simple like pipe shotguns or armored doors. You need to gather a lot of scrap to craft these things and it is a high amount of scrap. I still think the game is fun but it is just to much to play.,Rust

426799,2014-04-06,0,0,110,False,Recommended,Review Contents Abstract Gameplay Graphics Biomes Audio Performance Bugs Final Verdict 1. Abstract Rust is an online survival game that puts you against the elements and other players. The video shown on the store page does not accurately depict the gameplay. Yes you will have many intense battles only if you play the hours of grinding before hand. The game in its current state (First day post release) is playable doubt its worth $40 to anyone. In this review you will be reading my perspective on the game may not reflect everyones but I have over 100 hours in it most of which were played in Legacy Rust (pre unity 5) less than half on unity 5 and then 10 ish hours post release. 2. Gameplay Rust's gameplay is very grindey to start with but this isn't the most boring grind on earth. You need to learn the mechanics of the game to enjoy it a short few youtube tutorials should get the game going. Playing with friends is a sure way to also get your money's worth. The grinding is to get materials for the crafting system. The crafting system is well designed with a tiered system requiring different tiers of tools to create better weapons. Ontop of the tiered system there is a certain level of unlocking to do it's not through a pay wall or through a grind wall. You can unlock by finding blueprints by scavenging dangerous areas or by researching the item you want to create in the future by finding one and using research tools. The PVP aspect is where the game shines but also takes a dive. The PVP is well made great netcode great gameplay. Only issue with PVP is that most people are s you will forsure get killed many times as soon as you start the game dying without a chance to achieve shelter and basic tools makes the game impossibly hard to progress in. If you can over come the horrible people you will forsure have fun. 3. Graphics Graphics are quite impressive although on release day there's still some work to be done. Your character will not render feet but your body can cast odd shadows foliage tends to float and occasionally building bits will clip with eachother although easily fixed by careful placement. During sunrise and sunset the game really shines with the colours day time is nice and bright allowing players to see far for enemies and gather materials far faster. Nights are pitch black scary and the best time for sneaking around. Night time is immersive with how the lighting works when other players run around with torches. Expect nothing short of wonders going into this game. 4. Biomes The biomes in this game deserves its own section facepunch studio went through great deals of changes to masterfully craft the biomes in this game. There are a few biomes to name forests flat planes deserts oasis and caves I'm sure I missed a few. The forests feel really thick with foliage all over the ground thick trees to obscure vision and the audio rustling when you run through the foliage. The desert is baren with occasional sections of cactuses or palm trees. Oasis' form between deserts where you might find horses or pigs to kill you can even set fish traps there! The most interesting and awesome biome are the caves deep webbed caves that go far down have small platforming puzzels and lots of mineable ores. 5. Audio The music in the game is quite minimal very ambient and fitting. You won't find the music overwhelming in any situation though it can feel off sometimes when nothing is happening around you but the music picks up. The sounds of the guns firing is loud and clear allowing players to hear gun fights from afar. 6. Performance I tested the game on max settings on a GTX 1070 i5 6500 and 8gb of ram. On max settings the game ran 99% of the time over 75 fps. Although performance for lower end computers may vary wildly. The settings allow for all sorts of adjustments to allow the game to look and run the way you want. 7. Bugs I mentioned before the foliage tends to float. This probably happens due to the fact that the maps are procedurally generated. Small issue but quite noticable along cliff edges. Sometimes items in your inventory will switch to boxes in troublesome ways I occasionally find myself losing items only to realize the game put them in the storage boxes I was interacting with earlier. 8. Final Verdict The game provides good content for its money if you can learn the game mechanics and have friends to play with. If you plan to play this game solo maybe wait for a price drop to $30 CAD or eqivalent in your currency.,Rust

426834,2014-07-05,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,Until one can host one's own server rather than either paying for private hosting or playing with a bunch of strangers under the threat of griefing and/or the server going down due to any moronic reason (or simply stopping to pay the host and thusly being closed) plus having to deal with high pings or players you can't avoid (as doing such would force you into servers with higher latencies) this game is not worth buying not because it is bad (for it isn't) but because playing it with friends on a ping friendly and safe server is impossible not because it hasn't been implemented but because a password is required for the game to be playable and as of yet only hosting companies have access to said password.The main problem is not paying for hosting it's being forced to pay for a service I do not need that after having paid for the game already I understand this is an Early Access Game and crashes instabillity and such should be (and are) expected however servers are running! In fact for it to be expected of me to pay for the servers they ought to be rather stable so it's not a stabillity issue.I (and obviously I can't speak for anyone else) don't mind hosting a server even if it might crash or freeze or just die on me out of the blue this is an Early Access Game after all. Renting a server either it is always an option for the people who can't be arsed to port forward and set things up and are not bothered with the problems I brought up in paragraph 1. I expect in the future the release of a dedicated server client for players but until then the game good as it might be or become is simply not worth buying which is a shame because I'll most likely change my review once the server hosting is released. The game as of yet without a 'single player mode' (which I don't know if will ever be implemented as I haven't seen any mention of it) or a server client avaliable is unplayable (to me obviously This is a personal review).I bought the game this early on its develpment because I believed in Rust's premisses I still do this game has a lot of potential and I ween it will fulfill itself as a game that's why though I may not recommend it being bought If you happened agree with paragraphs 1 and 2 I eagerly wait the full release of the game as I'm sure I'll have a lot of fun with it and my friends.Until then Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Spycrab Steam wgah'nagl fhtagn.,Rust

426843,2017-08-07,0,0,47,True,Recommended,Rust begins off as a love and hate relationship. But it slowly becomes one of the best survival games you'll ever play. First of let me say Rust is not an easy game. You'll have to be active work hard and learn the game. It's a very time consuming game. The devs are passionate about the game and update it every week non stop with no excuses. But of course theres always some cons about every game. First wipe day is crazy. Servers are full. Everyone is naked and trying to kill you with a rock. Second the servers slowly die down in days. There should be a bonus for staying on the same server. Third raiders can place twig structures anywhere on your base. To me this defeats the purpose of the tool cupboard. SummaryPros One of the best survival games. The devs are passionate and listen to the community Theres building Challenging A new experience every timeCons Wipe day is crazy The servers die in a few days Raiders can place twig structures anywhere at your base.Conclusion I highly recommend Rust. It's a very challenging and fun survival game. There is some cons to the game but it can always be fixed with the dev team.

426853,2017-10-14,0,0,1303,True,Recommended,This is my review for the game if you are still on the fence. I have had this game for 2 years already with a little over 1k hours. I took a year off because I hated some of the updates. As of 09 OCT 17 I came back because the new blueprint system came back. I love it and hope they keep it.So this game is the most addicting game I have played ever. The grind in it is reasonable and it feels like you have actual goals and when you achieve them it makes you feel accomplished. When you are in combat I have never had the same feeling in any other game. Just the pressure of not getting killed when your inventory is full of loot from a raid or you have been farming wood and stone is just thrilling. I have been fearing for my life not to die and lose all of my stuff and it s every fight every fight I get that feeling if I die I will have to go back out and farm for another 15 minutes if not more just to get all of it back. I love it.The combat in this game has improved drastically. Great weapon selection and fits anyone s fight style if you want to be a sniper in the back they got that or a run and gunner they got that too. Since 2 years ago Everything feels a lot smoother and the combat faster paced. All of the rad towns just look so much more alive since 2015 and now their is harbor gas stations and rocket facility. All of them have a their own personality and benefits to going too. To me it s incredible how much more detailed they are from 2015 from looking like some barebones models to now having plant life growing on them graffiti and rubble all around. Hats off to facepunch .Only thing I can saw to improve the game is to stop listening to the community as much especially the subreddit. It s mostly screaming 14y/o s and just toxic. Their have been many good suggestions but the complaining their is far too much and not enough constructive criticism. Also it would be nice to have official 1 3 man group servers because many of the community or modded ones do not have enough population or die off quickly.I just recently tried playing solo on a official server and it s difficult. Just imagine playing a game on hard mode. That is what playin solo is. Granted I don t want FP to cater to solos or small groups but neither too clans. I believe their is a happy medium and FP will find it through CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. I started playing the game with about 5 guys from work and I believe to get the full rust experience you have to find a group. I felt like I was part of something when I played and legitimately cared when someone was hurt or when we were raiding the relief of finally getting into the loot room and all of us screaming about the loot. This game is great to play with friends and you really build bonds. This game currently is only 20 bucks a low price for the amount you get. If you have it buy it find a group to show you the ropes and enjoy. Also for new players PLEASE read the dev blogs so you know what s going on so you are not blind sided by something. No matter how many times you get killed or raided this game is still very good. This game is special even after a year break I came back too it and plan on keep playing. Buy the game and you will see what I m talking about.,Rust

The games rescources that it uses aren't correctly allocated and uses anything and everything it can. What this means in a non technical sense is that It over uses power in a Mac which in turn causes the game to run horribly and extremely slowly/laggy and heats up your computer to dangerous temps in the process of running the ame at its lowest video quality settings possible ( which is supposed to make the game run faster ). Final summation I would wait until they corretly allocate mac's rescoruce problem or get a better windows computer or just aviod this game on a mac completly.After windows Great Game and the 2nd version is amazing D its coming along amazingly well,Rust

Legacy Rust had a great community of people. To this day I am still in touch and playing socially with several mature players that I met during Legacy Rust from the U.S. Europe and Canada. Almost 4 years later this game's perhaps younger community has created an unfortunately toxic gaming environment to which many of my original Rust team players now stray away from and with good reason. Still Rust is fun depending on one's ""social toxicity tolerance"" level on a given day it has stolen many hours of my life due to it's unique concept sandbox setting addictive base building freedom and team strategy based elements.",Rust

It really take survival to another level and it makes really angry when you lose all your stuff after countless farming. The only thing that bothers me is the update that allowed other people to be able to place ladders and twigs on your base even if they are not authorized to the tool cupboard. And if your are playing solo you are kind of playing the game on hardcore difficulty.Here's some pros and cons.Pros.Good GraphicsMany weaponsGood crafting systemUpdates every weekBuilding system just got better aswell ( it was still good before )Cons.Ladder/Twig update.It's still in early access (although it was released in december 13 of 2013)Community is worse than in cs go but better then in dota.Overall If you are not ready to get killed hundreds of times and lose your stuff then this game is not for you.7/10 Will kill nakeds with rocks again.,Rust

426928,2017-03-31,0,0,58,True,Recommended,"My experience with this game can be summed as thus every update I found myself testing the changes nodding in satisfaction then quitting the game to await the next update.Arkane knows how to make a good game. No question. But if you film an Oscar worthy movie and the lens is smudged while filming you can't judge what's underneath without acknowledging what's been marring your experience the entire time. PERFORMANCE Everyone is aware of the performance issues and these still persist to this day. It runs much better than at launch where it was literally unplayable but that's because the game looks worse than before the most noticeable change being the extremely aggressive LOD scaling. Out of the corner of your eye you notice the shapes of window frames and posters on distant buildings morphing in shape or the furniture at the opposite end of a long hallway suddenly blinking into existence. FPS dropped to 15 when stabbing a gravehound so they simply removed the inky visual effect that was causing the problem instead of optimizing it.Also Denuvo authentication is one of the longest ""loading screens"" of the game. Around half a minute to a full minute or more every startup. GAMEPLAY For the most part gameplay is excellent and is Dishonored's strongest suit. Dark Vision was changed to a blurry short range sonar so unlike Dishonored 1 you aren't constantly seeing blue and yellow because you had no reason not toAI is much smarterNonlethal combat options are a blastBonecharm crafting system allows for player flexibility and ""builds""Each level feels lived in while maintaining the duality of directive flow and open options that made the first game so good.Emily and Corvo have distinct animations and final weapon upgrades. The animations are supremely cool.Each level is fairly distinct some with extremely interesting central ""gimmicks."" I do however wish the game relied less on them and had more ""regular"" areas.However under the hood lie other problems. Most of them are quality of life issues Gone are the hotkeys for journal inventory bonecharms powers. Only one ""journal"" exists now despite still having separate subsections.It took months for the power wheel to be fixed. It took almost a full second after activating to pop up and be usable breaking flow so badly I almost never used it in the first place. It's finally fixed now but this issue was glaring and it took so long to be addressed most of us played through without it fixed.Thrown objects don't always go exactly where your crosshair is. While this adds a layer of difficulty it feels noticeably more clunky than in the first game.Mana regen is pitifully slow. From using a power to fully regenerating Dishonored 1's time is 4.7 seconds &gt 3.1 seconds with Spiritual Pool. Dishonored 2's time with 4x Spiritual Pool is 6.3s &gt 5.5s. The devs said they fixed this effect but it was only made worse.Bugs. Street speakers not playing. Dying after possessing gravehounds. An arc pylon never shutting down after pulling out its power leaving it to either be dangerous to you to dangerous to your nonlethal playthrough. Some of these still aren't fixed. STORY AND ATMOSPHERE Reactivity Great. My favorite part of Dishonored. You need to hide from a gang member to access a certain black market shop and there are different scenarios and dialogue for if you hide if you run into him outside kill him outside or kill him inside.Emily and Corvo Emily and Corvo are voiced. And... they don't talk enough. It's good that they're silent for most of the game but there are times when you come across a portrait or photograph with an ""Inspect"" prompt. I'd love to hear Emily's thoughts on the High Overseer as see how that compares to Corvo's or if it changes based on whether or not you accept the Outsider's Mark. Instead all I get is the protagonist muttering the name of the person pictured. What's the point? Might as well keep them silent.It made sense to me to play Emily first but her story felt lackluster like people at every turn were saying ""check your royal privilege"" despite my efforts to resolve everyone's problems without drawing blood. Corvo's is MUCH more interesting as a veteran of Dishonored 1.The Outsider and The Void I hate the new Outsider and his new voice. He felt threatening and malicious in the first game due to how calm and composed he was and the Void felt like a strange and otherworldly place. The vignettes of Dunwall made it feel both unnatural and unnerving yet fundamentally woven into the universe. In Dishonored 2 it's just smoky blackness and sharp rocks. The Outsider is much jollier and moves around erratically making grandiose hand gestures. They actually had a plot plot that could explain this change but it was never addressed so it just seems like a pointless retcon to me.Main Plot Dishonored's worldbuilding was always one of its appeals and that remains true in Dishonored 2. However the villains felt lackluster. Only the main villain has a real presence throughout the game whereas everyone else feels introduced abruptly only to fall by your hand all within the same mission. In Dishonored 1 everything felt personal and real. Perhaps it was because of the long intro where you interacted with most of them or the Hound Pits's cast of characters all having different connections to your targets. As you can see I've played this game a LOT and have put a lot of thought into it. It was definitely worth all those hours and all that money but the condition it was at launch and the sluggish drip feed of support we barely get now is unacceptable. To set a precedent for future games I can't recommend buying this unless they manage to fix all the performance issues and bugs which doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon.",Rust

426930,2016-08-28,0,0,158,True,Recommended,( !!Tl dr warning!! )Firstly to anyone reading this post THANK YOU! Now on to what I'm about to say. SOLO IS DYING!!! No not the game in general that aspect is actually doing VERY well lately. What I'm talking about is players that have no friends no 'clan' to back them up going out straight from the beaches where they spawn and building up thier base. That whole chunk of the base of palyers is dwindling. It is increibly hard to be able to go alone in this game without having all of your hardwork torn down again and again AND again...and I know some of you can relate to this heavily. To be able to defend this way of playing the game we (the groups of people who go solo) need to raise of voices up and be heard saying 'Hey we're getting SCREWED out here can someone get things changed around here?!' I'm not saying mess over the whole game just aspects that kill off solo players so easily. *cough* Xp system *cough* grinding *cough* So basically what I'm saying is for gods sake don't kill off us little guys!! Please Facepunch!! But don't screw over the rest of the cummunity as well!! We need a balance to where we can defend ourselves in this torturous game without having to slave for what seems like endless hours only for a metal shack!! But seriously though I will NEVER call out this game as a terrible product unless it ever (sadly) becomes that. Thanks for reading this guys!!,Rust

426936,2016-11-26,0,0,990,False,Not Recommended,"Why No ?*please keep that on mind that this review is just my point of view at this game.* It changed a lot.Original idea that was rust how it was created how it works changed a lot as legacy player i seen all versions of this game and as far as i can say i enjoyed Legacy version most and somehow i played Rust until XP system comes. Lot's of things that where promised to old community and they where never been delivered to us.I don't know who was it if it was Garry or another developers or whoever was responsible for this game at the times when game changed from Legacy to newer version. But it was promised to us as for the old community what we recieve few changes. First was original legacy map that should be named as ""Hapisis island"" that was complete bull***t ? Why ? Simply this map was expecting by whole old community when it was delivered in patch it was something diffrent completley diffrent and unrecognizable from legacy map. It was not even explanined they did never say why did this happen and current appology is that it is hard to make 1 1 Old legacy map. For me this was one of the nails to coffin. We can talk about things like debuff's that was promised but never actually happend. Lot of players just leave the game because simply they never truly told us what is happening with game and why actuall promises in devlogs where never delivered to community. They considered to give us a level editor at launch of course it end up as promise that never happen... Current system. Dear lord i will recieve a hate for this but this is actual problem for me i was learned in this game to grind week a whole week of grinding hard working on blueprints fighting and now ?...Whole randomness that was given to us with blueprint system is gone. You start with 0 blueprint's that's ok so then you grabbing from barrels then you running like a madman trying to find a hazmat. Do lot of runs but where is randomness ? Bascily when you need something you know where you find it... want level 3 weapons go launchside want weapons grind barrells. This is why this game comes down from Week gameplay to a 3 day's gameplay. Peoples jus't now they raid like crazy it's not even hard right now... and at third day server is almost dead. Blueprint was more random and i feel it was made for this game ? Why... imagine situation like now. You have everything for raid and some simple gun before component/bp it was risk to go raid. Why ? You never know what that guy that you are going to raid will have. Sometime's he played pistols and guess what you come raid him he pulls AK47 stright away destroy's you whole raid just failed because you did not observe your target and never actually get's any information about him now its more like pingpong he comes outside and you can tell if raid will be or not sucessfull. It's boring and repetitive.Cluster f... to your mind.Why stable map was better but stable system is problem. This was the case of actual fun in this game with old map you just know you really know what to expect where big clans are going to build where players will be PVPing(""But hey PVT that's why POI's are there"" i know i know but before there where places where you fight even without POIS a great example of big PVP non POI place where Resource Valley and if u know that place well you could survive.) Or where you can go to hide or raid some solo/duo players. Everything on old map had a palce and with randomness of blueprints it was like symphony. PVP systemThis is my personal hate and why i hate so much PVP system at current rust build.Legacy again ?Yes legacy again and this was most or top or whatever you want reason why peoples like this game. Old legacy PVP system was just like Counter Strike. No bulletdrop some simple patterns and here you go perfect PVP game with some survival aspect. Current system of shooting looks like you take some very old old pistol add 30mag to it and make it shoot it just all over the place and it's disgusting it takes tons of times to learn it when you come from other games. Just meh in general. Upkeep systemFor me it's like hey you you dont have time for game ? Well say goodbye to your base... etc...Like nerfing in past false hopes for changes and etc... i would not even write about it because this will be review on 30 papers.Now let's see a better things that happen to this game(LOL).+Graphics+Building system+Good for peopels who never play this game before.+Some tutorial that is not helping.Conclusion For peoples who support this game at start and buy it and still hold up to this days good job but for me....It's just diffrent game its so diffrent that it have litteraly almost 20% from old and actual RUST that i used to know and enjoy. This game is almost dead to me one solution for me and maybe for players like me would be something like give us back old map stop promising t's and keep being sorry or full of excuses that it's not possible. Give us choose to create servers with old BP system and keep also current one for new players. For new players it might be a good game that they will like but as i said you have litteraly no guarantee that current system will not change even if they released this game.",Rust

426962,2017-07-25,0,0,335,True,Recommended,Would I recommend rust? As you can see I have hundreds of hours in the game. It cost me 10 dollars. For 10 dollars I would recommend almost any game. Rust is a special kind of awful. The player community is toxic. The gameplay is repetitive. The crafting element changes so often you're never sure of how you make anything. If you enjoy being ganked by mouthy ten year olds I definitely would recommend rust. If you enjoy having all your hard work destroyed again and again and again I would recommend rust. If you like playing with people that would kill you for a piece of wood that would be easier to get themselves than it would have been killing you I would recommend rust. After 300+ hours in the game I can tell you if not anything else it's a great way to kill time.If you want a real challenge I would recommend you play rust as a pacifist. After my first 10 hours in the game I decided to play it without making any of the weapons. I decided to help anyone who asked even the 55hats who did nothing but kill you repeatedly. I made the game enjoyable for me by doing my best to be the anti rust player. That's what made rust an interesting experience for me. Rust is like The Lord of the Flies for a modern age who have no idea what The Lord of the Flies is. I don't know if I'm qualified to reccomend rust to you but I can say if not anything else it's interesting. Rust may make you a worse person than you already are. Rust may tear you down to it's level. So good luck out there and remember the game is as good as you make it.,Rust
426963,2017-02-03,0,0,837,True,Recommended,Close to 900 hours in. None other game gave me such adrenaline rush and made me and my friends improve our teamwork as Rust did. I preferred the old Blueprint system but the new component system is fun too. My best advice is find the right server for your play style and avoid official server until your are prepared.,Rust

426965,2017-01-31,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,"You know when you play a game and find youself thinking ""You know what'd make this even more enjoyable dying all the time and playing with people who are s."" In Rust you can starve in half a day *long* before you die of dehydration.You can stand in a river. You *will* get wet and even get hypothermia if you stay in it too long but you *can't* drink from it. Why? Why have a survival mechanic for hydration when you're so frikkin hipster that the only water you can drink is bottled that you *might* find in containers?The mushrooms are apparently edible and give you a small boost to hunger hydration and health. The mushrooms are modelled on the fly agaric. You know the red one with white spots that's poisonous as . Are they *trying* to kill off idiots who'd eat one in real life *because they saw it in Rust*? If so I'd leave a kinder review the world needs less idiots. I suspect however it's because the colours stand out better on the background making it marginally easier to spot and tbh why bother thinking anymore about modelling an edible mushroom on one that's deadly irl...Meanwhile if you eat meat raw it will *actually harm you*. Yes there is a risk of food poisoning if the animal was ill and if it's not fresh but think how many people there are who like *rare* steak or sushi who miraculously survive everytime they eat it. What a ing dumb as mechanic.You can gather rusty metal plates and maybe even some wood but then find a bear *somehow* *without making any noise* is actually standing behind you and *oh dear* it hit you once and you're dead and you lost your scraps of crafting crap respawn in a random place and start again.You can always ask other players on the server for tips or even help but *oh dear* they're s and won't even try and help a newbie and are significantly more likely to kill you.In 2.2 hours of playing time I was killed something like 12 times once by a player who appeared behind me again without making a noise and *oh dear* one hit dead and the other *eleven times* by bears. Seperate bears. One I saw glitching next to a stream so I crouched down and walked away silently. The second I turned away it unglitched *bam* dead.On my last attempt of playing this game and bear in mind about 1/4 of the playing time was loading screens I happened to respawn near where to the two or three long time s of the server happened to be gathering crafting crap and ignoring/killing anyone else. I crouched and walked quietly up to the crates they were using took every single thing I could fit in my inventory out of them ran behind a rock and logged out. 'em.So in summary you get to run around naked until a bear or an kills you. Literally the most pointless piece of game I've ever bought I will be getting a refund for this.EDIT I *did* get a refund for this.",Rust

426971,2014-03-24,0,0,6,True,Recommended,After a couple of days with this I can write something about this game. This game has way more potential than it gives. I recommend it but only if it gets better. The new guys will have a hard time as I am. I've been playing this for a couple of days now and I have yet to get anywhere with it. There is one HUGE drawback which other MMO's have and that is to draw (higher level) players away from n00b areas of the game. Though this game has no levels it has bigger guns and fending off 2 people that have guns with a rock will not cut it. I could crush a skull in real life with the size of rock that you are given yet it takes hit after hit after hit to kill someone in this. If you are attacked by someone with an axe you bleed out and the only way to get away is to run away then patch yourself up before you do (if you're lucky enough to not have the person still chasing you). Food is hard to get with a rock too and you need to find resources where people hog so that you can build better weapons armour buildings etc. There are camps you can join and this will be the ONLY way you will get anywhere in this game. I was hoping to scope out the game by myself for a little before going into an occupied area but you can't. It's literally impossible to play this without making friends first unless the entire server is full of friendly's. Most people aren't unless you're part of their group. Another huge drawback is when you die you lose everything and there is no failsafe for this unless you have a storage unit that's well hidden or locked up which you need when you're first starting out. If you die you start out as a noob again (rock med kit and torch) unless you're lucky enough to find your drops if they hadn't taken it which is also unlikely. I had a ton of wood needed to build stuff then died of hunger. I ran around looking for food but there was literally nothing in a forest near a wide open field. I haven't asked anyone in game how to do anything yet but I may next time I login if I can't figure things out. To give you an idea you beat your n00b rock against a tree and it gives you wood. The tree does not fall down but rather displays a message telling you there is no more wood available (disappointing I know since we ALL should have hardware that can handle this kind of stuff). You would then use the wood to build stuff like wooden barracades or wooden shelters and the like. Instead of putting these items where you are building them they go into your inventory (how the hell do you carry a shelter around?). I haven't figured out how to take the items out of the inventory to place them on the land yet though. Drag and drop just puts a bag in front of you with items in it (seriously a shelter in a bag?). You can pick these up again easy enough. I haven't been able to do much else because I get killed so quickly and gathering wood doesn't exactly help you build a better weapon right away. For a new weapon you need to do the impossible and find rocks which people seem to be guarding the resources for because of where the resources are located (and very few of them). The map needs to be a LOT bigger (or at the very least different bigger maps) with more resources and better resources to lure players with better equipment away from the noobs. As I mentioned before the trees not falling was a big disappointment for me. I would have rather cut down a tree then harvest it for wood. The graphics are sub par at best. Trees rocks shadows and characters (including the animals) all have low res textures. The only thing good about the graphics is the amount of grass and it makes the fields look grassy instead of fake. Add the trees and it looks better but only from a distance. When you kill animals in the game you get chicken no matter which animal you kill. Would like to see variances in the food and amount of hunger satisfied by the food (since a steak is bigger than a chicken leg pork chop etc. and a pork chop is bigger than a chicken leg but not much). I understand that this game is still in alpha stage and can still change drastically but all in all this game has HUGE potential and I hope that it will change for the better. It needs to so anyone new will not be so frustrated like I was (am).,Rust

426976,2014-03-24,0,0,55,True,Recommended,"I got this game a few days ago and I gotta say this is fun as hell but there's way to much KoS'ing. Be prepared to die. A lot.First server I joined was chalked full of KoS'ers around the good resource places so within 3 minutes of playing I gave up on collecting rocks n stuff and tried my luck at raiding a house I found with a wooden door. 10 minutes later I had full kevlar and an m4 after I accidentally accused one of the few friendlies on the server of KoS'ing me. Thinking the game was too easy I went around raiding for about another 2 or 3 hours before being worshiped by the moderately well geared players as ""the luckiest n00b ever"". My luck was about to run out. I built a nice base in the mountains and had tons of gear and got contacted by a n00b helping ""friendly"" and his buddy who invited me on a night raid. Needless to say they took everything I had and killed my buddies. I quickly switched servers.The second server I joined had more friendlies but they mainly stuck to themselves. I teamed up with another n00b for a while and collected wood to make a base but got KoS'd while going to the place I had built up shelter before. I decided to switch servers again. I hopped around on more servers for a couple of hours before settling down on the server I'm currently playing on. Me and my buddies built ourselves a small base in the mountain in the middle of the map and logged off for the night. When we came back online we found our base heavily raided so we decided to move. After finding a nice place to set up shop we built up a base and collected a ton of resources for further building. A few hours later an airdrop lands right next to our base and the one major group of KoS'ers finds me and my base. They kill me a lot. But I kept coming back and eventually they actually gave me an m4 mp5 2 pistols and a research kit. Somehow I had accidentally made an ally of the strongest and most feared group on the server. They've stopped KoS'ing me and now I'm aiming to build a metal base way in the north away from everyone. I only have a little over 36 hours logged in the game. This n00b has got some skill. Can't wait to see what else gets added in game.",Rust

It's rather boring to play alone or with a small group of friends and on larger servers it's hard to do anything without getting killed immediately upon spawning. So the options are playing privately or on an empty ish server or playing on a large server and getting killed upon spawning. The first option is boring as there are really no threats to your survival to make a serious challenge and the second option just sucks for new players trying to join a server.Once again I compare this survival game to 7 Days to Die which is challenging thanks to the zombies and day 7 hordes and other game mechanics.,Rust

I finally got around to making a house and it just so happened to be next to the biggest raider on the server. He blamed me for killing his pet chicken and putting a door in his house. Me and my friend killed him meanwhile a guy was banging down our door with a rock. METAL DOOR. He BROKE IT DOWN and took the food and guns. When the raider came back everything was gone by the one noob who stole our stuff AND theirs. Yay for stories!",Rust

The maps should be bigger and more rad towns should be improved to the game. Like a city with school food area (Resturant) and like shops with clothes that you can take from manekins (the white plastic human doll). And more guns should be developerd. With this i mean there is more forest then there is to explore. But I would say that if they fix more rads city or town the. This game will be sooo popular.And like abounded subways in the city. If you developers fix this I swear this game will be at the top on the first summer day next yearThis game is awesome you should definitely get it it's worth the money and you can easily make friends.And I also want the developers to make it easier to get weapons cause now I want them to add zombies ),Rust

I played it back in 2015 where I played the game hours on end and found it extremely addictive. However through the multiple changes of the game and the development path it has taken down until now I find it difficult for this game to have me captivated for even five minutes. Honestly I've just gotten tired of this game now. The xp system was alright and the components system was kind of just meh. But the current crafting table system is just not my style anymore you can't be really creative with building anymore because of daily upkeep costs that were implemented and the recoil changes make gunplay less unique. Overall I can't play this game and have fun anymore. Sure go ahead and take it for a spin. But I'm done.,Rust

Its a much more harsh experience compared to games like Ark because your number one enemy in Rust is not nature but all the humans you play with (though bears will mess you up).Sadly with the many latest updates for Rust basebuilding has gotten incredibly mediocre with focus on making automatic turrets and traps rather than fortifications in the shape of engenious construction work. Forced server wipes upon forced server wipes has made it a pain just to play the game. With the added component based crafting it is now more of a scavenger hunt vs. other players than a harsh fight for food and water. simply put bad update after bad update has made me change my standing from ""The best survival game i own"" to ""im going to uninstall it and never play it again"".I can no longer recommend this game to anyone.",Rust

Rust is a very fun game where you can connect with friends or just people you meet and try to survive against nature and other players wanting a little bit of your hard earned loot. If pvp isnt your thing there are hundreds of servers with little to no people on them. But if you like pvp then you can join some of the more populated servers where you have to look over you shoulder while you collect some rock or wood. There are also a fair few servers that offer a PUBG version of the game where you can fight against other players to increase you skill in combat or just have a good time.,Rust

Many depends on you don't trust anyone or make strongest friendship ever.Now about some horrible disadvantages their anti cheat politics. There is no ban safe warranty for any player. You may get banned if you didn't cheat as well as you won't get banned even if you cheat for months. The game is also unsafe from script using dishonest players (no recoil script as example). Playing on modded servers (the ones that use legal plugins) you may discover that your key bindings are getting collapsed each time you launch the game. I got banned for creating a script for myself that was replacing corrupted cfg file into a working one each time i launch Rust. I went even further and got myself a new copy of a game. And quickly discovered that there are still some other players with aimbot and wallhack which were not banned unlike me. The most irritating thing is the EAC anti cheat. You can't appeal they don't provide any evidence or reports from other player on you. They just ban. Pretty dubious politics of behavior some people are being banned for 8 years already. Hey finnish rats from EAC if you follow zero tolerance style of business to the ones who cheat on your opinion you'd better look deeper into each case. Otherwise is just a rip off of people's wallet. There won't be any cheaters indeed since everyone will be banned.Summarizing the game is cool but think twice before purchasing it.,Rust

I first played 4 years ago with kevelar armor and all that But some went down with the old account and i got banned for ""hacking"" its been 4 years and i tried again. Now rust is a hard game to review because of wipes. One wipe your walking around fully geared next wipe you have a 2x1 the whole wipe struggling to roam with bows. now I didnt know how to rate this. yes or no? I say yes because in rust you have VERY i mean VERY thrilling and fun moments. Like raiding a jackpot base. But then you have EXTREMELY boring moments like when you hike up dome get nothing then die because you failed a jump. Now for people reading this who never played. It is a intresting game. Not only is the game hard but the community is stupidThe community Toxic af but still can have fun and interact. will play downstairs in the basement for 48 hours on wipe day. The community is why i struggle to say yes to the game. Take out the community and its an awesome game. Dont get me wrong the community is funny af. people jump off towers screaming REEEE.Specs I have a gtx 960 and run around 50 60 fps. I honestly dont care if i have 40 or 80 frames per second as long as i have more then 30 fps im fine with it. I dont notice frame drops too much in rust. Unless its a war zone or a raid on High Pop servers.I honestly struggle to give this game a rating but i say 7/10 because of how fun it can be. I say try this game if you dont know about it ask a friend if you can try it there. Rust is annoying. Makes you salty even if you are never salty. Overall i give it 7/10",Rust

I haven't had any issues with hacking (not to say it doesn't exist) but still have a problem with raiders. I am all for open world PvP but feel as though a properly upgraded base should provide players with a bit more security. In all honesty this is the ONLY complaint I have with the game. I would love to see the following implemented into the game Stronger base capabilities various trap systems would be incredible! BRING BACK SOME FORM OF ZOMBIES (please!)

427223,2018-02-08,0,0,2404,False,Recommended,This game has had it's ups and downs I've played for a very long time met some of the most awesome people and some of the most toxic ones i love it to death tho the community needs some work but with a little searching you can find the community that fits you the building system still needs a little wotk but is rather smooth and great regardless the devs care for this game and have taken care of everyone's complaints the best they can and in response have fixed so many of the biggest problems we've had in the game I honestly say give it a shot go to a low pop server to get a hang of it and build your way up. it truely can be a rewarding experiance to play.,Rust

Problem is people raid you whiile your not on the server and you get low people who just camp noobs all the time.

427237,2018-02-18,0,0,75,False,Recommended,Early access PUBG runs better than this game. That says a lot honestly. This game is still very unoptimized despite it being out of early access. Lowering the graphics options barely does anything to fix the framerate drop and I have decent specs that can run games on higher graphics settings fine. I literally get more FPS from PUBG on ultra than I do in this game on lower graphics settings.But you know what it's fun. There's lots of stuff to do lots of possibilities and I appreciate the challenge of survival it brings up especially in... m multiplayer.Don't enter multiplayer servers alone your will get ed believe me. But this is the same for any other multiplayer survival game.Rust has a bunch of depth to it much more than you'd ever expect and I appreciate that. There's so much you can do when building bases crafting etc. that the game has unlimited replayability. And even though the dangers of survival in this game are the same every time they're always unexpected.,Rust

Now it's all about group battles killing noobs hording profanity and being a general douchbag. This game turned to crap once Facepunch focused on group play. Now It's horrible playing casually. You earn too slowly &amp you get raided after a couple hours. You can have a crappy wood shack and a group of guys will come tear it down just because they don't benefit from it infact it wastes their resources. Servers are all littered with already raided bases because groups do nothing but go out and raid just because. I did mention that in the past there were glitches yes but at least those didn't kill you. Imagin casually exploring the ocean in your wetsuit &amp diving gear. No need to worry you have 5 min of air... Yup then you drown randomly for no reason with 545 seconds left of air in your scuba gear. Amazing!Facepunch needs to scrap Rust and themselves.

I was fortunate enough to have 2 other friends who bought the game and later on met a few of really good friends.

But i have had a blast playing this solo and in a group before and i still would recommend this game for others to try. But for me i have lost interest in the game after the new BP/Component system as i see u spend more time trying to get those gears rather than roaming around doing pvp or other stuff.To finnish this i am looking forward to what the devs have in plans for this game.,Rust

427311,2018-02-24,0,0,91,False,Recommended,This game is... interesting.When you are starting out much of the game is running around naked and beating people to death with rocks or stabbing them with pointy sticks. When they kill you however you have to be really good at begging for your life.If you manage to live long enough you can acquire some resources to help you build a base to keep you safe from those people out there. Only problem is now people target you because they know you have stuff and you are constantly worried about losing it all.Problem is you can't just sit in your base because if you sit in your base your base decays and eventually crumbles into nothingness thus forcing you to go outside and gather resources to keep your base maintained thus putting you at risk of death.Soon as you think you're doing well some jackass with a nailgun comes kills you and takes all your stuff and back to square one you go.Overall it's a 10/10 game.

427316,2018-02-24,0,0,442,False,Not Recommended,"So why am I not recommending Rust? Many reasons. 1. Grindfest. Ever since the implementation of the scrap and component system the game has become a chore especially for small groups and solo players. I personally quit when I was devoting 60 hours a week to maintain a small base with basic gear.2. Lack of direction from game devs. As much as I like Helk and Garry they both don't know what the final vision of this game is going towards. It first started as a serious ish survival game then survival game with elements of counter strike and now its just a week long PUBG simulator with bases.3. Servers. The ""Official"" servers have been a garbage for a while. They are filled with cheaters massive clans and DDOSers. The community servers are extremely unreliabled. Crashing frequently abusive admins are getting constantly DDOSed and some even adapted the Pay 2 Win method of monitization. 4. Leaving Early Access. This game is plagued with numerous bugs exploits and optimization issues. It is in no state to be ready for full release. From what I could gather from the dev blogs it seems that they justified this by saying ""Because we want to slow down development to work on other things"". If the devs want to slow down development for Rust I'm cool with that but it just seems that they are trying to use the Full Release to poorly justify this. Plus see point 2. 5. Constant sales and the cheater problem. This game has been sold for extremely low prices in the past year. The lowest I've ever seen was about $2 in a humble bundle. This low price combined with the fact they use one of the worst anti cheats out there (easy anti cheat) has led to a quite high rise in cheaters. Even to the point where many people will not play if the game is on sale to avoid cheaters. Ending Note. I did once love this game and it was once a game I pointed at when people asked what was a good Early Access game but now it just feels like a shell of what it once was. I really did wish that Rust didn't become what it is now and still hope that it can become as great as it once was.",Rust

Rust is a great game but there is still one MAJOR problem draging around for years... most of the servers (unless you want to play on biggest servers with 15 man clan people) just die after 1 or 2 days and there's practically no reason to play the game if everything you achieved would matter no more after a day... big big problem really i guess that pure BP system back in 2015/2016 really kept the game most alive than ever.,Rust

This makes it too difficult for new people to get going. I can t reccomend it for small groups but if you have a large friend circle go for it. Also this game is not for people who are too nice like it will tear you down how mean people will be but that s what they have to do to survive.,Rust

427321,2018-02-25,0,0,7,False,Not Recommended,As much as I really want to like this game I cannot recommend this for anyone that is looking for fun or a semi relaxing game of survival and resource gathering. This review is not based on my experience with gameplay or the mechanics that the game has. The one reason that I can't recommend this game is mainly because of the people that play it. It doesn't matter if you are a passive player walking around gathering resources you will still die to by people with powerful weapons and strong armor. Yes I get that raiding is a big thing about this game but it's just not fun nor ok if you die every 5 minutes after respawn. It's not worth the money that I paid for it and I don't think I can ever find myself playing this ever. If you ever find this game at 50% or more on sales by all means pick it up with a couple of friends. Other than that I would rather play MineCraft than this game.,Rust

427323,2016-11-07,0,0,1661,False,Recommended,"all right es sit down and buckle up for a bumpy ride were I talk ab Rust I started playing this game during the original Blueprint progression system btw.Rust is the most unforgiving hardest game to get into piece of but once you get in and figure what the flying is going on it's all worth it.By the way if you play this game solo you're either a) a very good veteran player and / or streamerb) autisticPlay this game with friends or you're gonna have a bad time and don't expect to make friends with people in this game cause the community is more toxic than Chernobyl ever since around the experience progression system.This game has seen good and bad days but things are starting to fall into place. Combat system feels fluid for the most part guns are where they should be. Guns that cost high amounts of resources have a definite advantage on lower tier guns but also take a slight more amount of skill to use i.e. high damage but very high recoil.The current progression system is also exactly where it should be despite the fact that I (personally) despise it. Personally it feels like a crawl trying to find the item then the scrap to research it only to then go back out and farm resources to make it and that fact that if you get the item or not from a crate is totally random doesn't help much either. I feel like it heavily harms veteran players who like to occasionally drop in for maybe a week use their skills that they've aquired over the time they've played to make some insane plays on other players then be rewarded for their skill by getting more stuff in less time to me it should be like that if you're good at a game it should show however with the new progression system it forces those veteran players with 1000's of hours to go back to exactly what they hate to do farm . The reason they gave a to get good at the game was so that they could outskill other playewrs through PvP and thus completely disregard a need for farming however the current progression system hinders that process a ton.What this means is the system is good for new players as they are more willing to stick around for the farming process and there will be less guys who can 1v6 your zerg clan who bought the game on sale 5 days ago.To conclude these two points Rust was a mess and is still a big mess animal AI is bewilderingly there are lots of bugs and dumb that will you off but this game is a mess you will come to love. It's definitely not gonna fix it's hot mess of a self any time soon but it' still worth the hassle. And with the current look of the devs's update roadmap this game has my hopes high for turning into something truly spectacular when it's done.Although tbh for where the game is at right now it's definitely not worth $40 I can't stress it enough wait for a sale.And a lil' personal game play story for those of you who stuck through this review to the end &gt be me&gt be 17&gt still loving rust&gt veteran player setup giat zerg base with other 5 guys who easily all have over 1000 hours&gt arab guy in group ""guys lets build a mosque""Holy muddafuq shett good idea&gt build giant 10 x 10 mosque&gt thing would make allah cry&gt neighbors frequently see us go in out&gt think its our base since they don't know ab underground true base&gt they begin to online raid mosquetheres not even a single gun in there&gt they waste 10+ rockets&gt our guy runs up waterpipes guy and get ak + rocket launcher&gt we gun down rest of them in name of allah&gt week later begin to raid them&gt screaming ""YOU WILL ALL DIE IN THE NAME OF ALLAH""&gt guys blasting ISIS music over mic&gt mow down every single one as they try to defend their base from the storm of rockets we fire at themNo one s with my rust mosque",Rust

427350,2018-10-22,0,0,1572,False,Recommended,I've played Rust for close to a year now and in the past year it has been my most played game and quickly climbed that ladder up to my favorites. I absolutely LOVE the rustic decaying artstyle. The gameplay however is definelete not for everyone. Unless you have a group to play with Rust will be a difficult game especially when starting. You have to have hours of time to spend on this game maintaining upgrading (primarily) researching etc. But when you get raided it feels like the world just collapsed ontop of you. Me being a solo player quickly learned that my prioreties seem to fall into running as far away from spawn as possible and then trying to make a base. I will admit I have gotten really mad and ragequit countless times. The game can be extremely frustrating but somehow just keeps drawing me back in. I only paid $10 for the game and I don't think i would have paid $35 for it but it has definaletely been an adventure. I would recommend this game if you have a bit of time to waste each day and you enjoy a good challenge but Rust is not for the casual player ESPECIALLY if you plan to go solo.,Rust

427375,2018-02-24,0,0,399,False,Not Recommended,I'd like to recommend this game because I had some fun times back in the day but unfortunately I can't. I'm a solo/duo player mostly because of my casual gaming lifestyle. I don't like to join big groups where it ends up being a job because you have to be on at certain times or you have to do tasks put forth by the so called leader of the group. The most frustrating part of this game which has been mentioned I've seen many times is the offline raiding aspect of the game. Getting raided and having intense gun fights is part of the fun of the game. Someone shows up you fight for your life to protect your stuff that's what makes it fun. If I lose all my stuff because I failed at defending my base I can deal with that. But when I spend a whole day farming collecting and building only to wake up the next day log on and see that everything I did the day before is gone with no hope of stopping it practically every single day that's too frustrating. If that's something you think you can deal with then you could have a lot of fun on this game. Personally if that aspect was different I might give this game another try. Maybe they could do something like 7 days to die has. When nobody is online with permissions on a tool cupboard the stuff in range of the cupboard is fortified or something. Maybe that would deter people from doing so much offline raiding. I'm sure people would try to exploit it and just have one person have permissions to build then never be on but I'm sure you could find a way to counteract that as well. I guess just my opinion but personally I don't like losing everything I've worked for without a hope of stopping it on a daily basis.,Rust

427378,2015-10-26,0,0,2534,True,Recommended,This is probably my favorite post apocalypse survival game to date And there are so many to choose from on steam I have played a good amount of them and Rust always sticks with me it has an addictive feel to the game. On most servers you will find yourself nervously attempting to make yourself civilised enough in terms of tools and weaponry to stay alive long enough to build a base and make it strong enough to withstand a raid. Other servers are purely for building and community pleasure and you meet a lot of great people in game eager to help you which cannot be said about the PvP servers even if someone is friendly on a PvP server you have a strong instict not to trust them and leave you for dead once they have robbed you blind. Here are a decent list of reasons why i choose Rust over so many survival titles *Dev team are solid on bringing new cool stuff with every update whist working on bugs from previous builds. * You actually feel threatened even in the safety of your base (Door campers zergs etc) keeping you on guard.* The look feel and atmosphere of Rust all way down the the maps and sound fx keeps you hooked* The many many options you have while building* Being able to customize your character to great lengths* The combat feels really intense and realistic.All in all over all other titles i would choose Rust I heavily recommend you to do the same.,Rust

427398,2016-09-20,0,0,178,False,Recommended,"2016 review Got killed by a guy after we shot him 1 time with a shotgun and 3 times with a gun. He shot 2 times with a crossbow and we got killed. Also rocks are the stupidest thing to find the game is when it comes to rocks. Also animals clip through everything so you can't catch or run away from anything. Also bears walk on water. UPDATE Other than a horrible cheating issue where you can instant heal and make walls instantly to the best material you have on you. They mostly fixed the above issues. (I did shoot a person 3 times with a modded out Spas 12 with slugshots in the face from 5 feet away in the span of about 3.5 seconds. And he ended up spamming me in the face with a pistol and i died *note* i was wearing brand new metal face mask and metal armor and he had nothing on. Admin did not call any cheats from his ""logs"" but i can't see how anything else would be possible with the sounds of me hitting him.) So yea cheating is still an issue but they fixed alot of bugs improved gameplay graphics and animal AI. That is no more bears walking on water deers clipping through rocks etc. The fact that they kept adding stuff and fixing issues must be held to praise with these devs adding boats and all the things you would expect that come with boats. I can now sucessfully conclude this review from a would not recommend to a would recommend. Good price fun with friends and devs work harder than PUBG devs so yea overall great job.",Rust
427399,2018-11-10,0,0,48,False,Not Recommended,In my first few hours of playing rust was great and completely fun and enjoyable. the only thing I would have to complain about is the high toxic level of immature players on all servers.... it sure isnt easy and requires alot of time and proper stragety in order to succesfully deffend or raid another players base... the one thing I would like much more is an option setting to disable chat showing up unless you are typing in it... over all the game runs great Great graphics and 99.9% lag free unless you conect to someones server thats running off a there low buget pc... Game could still use alot more improvments tho... Like an option to sucide if you have nothing in your inventory because the game has trolls that knock you down and take your stone rock and tourch... you cant do anything then you gotta spend 10 minutes to find a cliff Look for something to clim up to jump off of swim to a drown at the beach... or find Animals that attaks you.... this game is a waste of time..,Rust

Its walking simulator mixed with battle royal and loads of jank. Tried it again recently to see if there where any improvments none that i could see besides a new microtransaction store. I asked other players too show me the ropes but it was just full of try hards and children who just went full ADHD. Basically you spawn try to grind get shot in the back repeat for an eternity. I honestly cant remember the last time I had such a tedious boring and annoying experience. This is the kind of game that makes me want to give up this hobby as a whole. All in all I say avoid this ""game"" like the plague. Its already clear that a toxic community like this shrinks the already obscure player base and will kill the game in the end.",Rust

It is like ARK but doesn't require as higher FPS. I spent 8 hours straight building a 5 story base with reinforced walls loot weapons and much more. This is a very fun game to play with your friends. I suggest starting out with your friends because it is very hard. There are very hardcore people that will kill you with a bow even if you have a gun.

427429,2018-11-11,0,0,409,False,Recommended,after a long while of play around 90 hours i can tell this game is one of the best games that u could ever buy however it has few problems within it.1.ITS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY SOLO no matter how good you are you either will die on road when building when farming or whenever you go offline the night your base will be raided by clans.2.REALLY BAD OPTIMIZATIONS lot of times when i click to join severs it crashes the whole game and i have to restart the steam all over again3.GRINIDNG FOR SCRAP as a new player you will think only problem in your life is to just get stones metals and wood but when you get enough experience you will realise that you need one more thing and that is scrap which you will get very little each run through out the map but you need insane amount when back in home and if you dont have scrap you will basically fight sniper rifles players with your hand made bow which brings two problems together one well again you need others to help each other grinding scrap and its frustrating doing it solo and.two its repetitive and time consuming which you litteraly have to go to the same roads hit barrels with what ever weapon you have and collect scraps.3RD problem i think is the worst part of this game especially if you dont have anyone to play with imagine your base is on very south of the map and if you choose one road and go all the way up and hit barrels and collect scraps and not die to duos and sniper clans which build theire basis right on top of those roads you will come back with around 100 150 scrap to home and it will take around 20 up to an hour depending on your tool which you brake barrels or how many you do on each area and each side in real life day you will find around 500 scrap each day if you play all day because thats not the only need of the game coz in the mean time you need ton of other things to do and you will be stuck at maximum crossbow while others use ak47s 4. AI human AI in this game is pain in the which together with 3rd problem will prevent solo players from geting end game guns even more.there are caves and places which you can go and find guns so you can bring those home and learn how to craft same guns by again using scraps which well first of all good luck getting in those places and getting out while clans farm those places every second and second even if you go there good luck killing AI with your cross bow which gaurd the place why?ok let me tell you why.Ak kills player with around 2 to 5 shots on average.same ak kills an AI around 4 to 8 shots on average.bow kills a player on average 4 to 10 (they are not idiot they heal as you shoot each time) same bow kills AI... oh wait it doesnt unless you shoot them 100 time and consedring there is 10 to 20 AI covering each place well good luck again geting your hand on that gun again.so long story short either play on servers that are almost empety like less than 5 players or have at least one good friend that plays everytime you play the game or have your patience level maxed out in real life otherwise you will brake ten keyboard and monitors each day other than that you are fool if you dont buy this game coz you will miss a lot.,Rust

I also have played a lot of vanilla survival which is fun but i think role play is still better.,Rust

At every chance not even brough on by the other members of the comunity I've been ed. Getting kicked out of queues on servers for no reason and given no error message has happened commonly and for those who haven't played the games the queues on a large server take a ridiculous amount of time. On top of that the new AI that they have implimented that is supposed to provide a safe zone will kill you for aggression which is should if you are being chased by people who are trying to camp it out and you run inside in hopes of them saving you they will shoot and instantly kill you because thats how good AI work. If you chose to subject yourself to the constant weekly wiping which makes all of your work meaningless the AI that can't get its finger off of the trigger even to those that are trying to flee certain death and possibly the most toxic community on steam good luck...

The crafting and building is insanely easy and fun. Its also very rewarding to get resources and work up to being the best. But the good things kind of stop there. The character modles are so rubbery and move in choppy manners the only way to get over it is to laugh it off. There are almost no animals in the map so it feels very fake and baren. I know most people complain about the community and how everyone is a and will kill you on sight but though this is a true statement for the most part Ive also met some very nice people who have spared my life and even helped me. And it is a survival game so you shouldnt explect anyone to be your bestie. It really is survival of the fittest or survival of the one who plays most. If you put time and effort into the game you will be rewarded. I recommend this game (but on a side note if you are debating buying this or ARK buy ARK. Better animals and stuff). Just watch your back look out for bears be slow to trust people and youll do just fine.,Rust

427568,2017-03-02,0,0,528,False,Not Recommended,A dielectric (or dielectric material) is an electrical insulator that can be polarized by an applied electric field. When a dielectric is placed in an electric field electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in an electrical conductor but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing dielectric polarization. Because of dielectric polarization positive charges are displaced in the direction of the field and negative charges shift in the opposite direction. This creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric itself. 1 If a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules those molecules not only become polarized but also reorient so that their symmetry axes align to the field.,Rust

The player is ready to nail this noisy man but notices something changed in Chad's lyrics. He's no longer singing the All Stars lyrics but he's actually asking the player to join as a team whilst keeping the song's melody. The player accidentally shoots Chad apologises and accepts Chad's request. The duo then traverses the planes singing All Stars repeating the same procedure when encountering a new player.When Chad's team reaches 4 to 5 members Chad's singing finally ceases.

You can gather materials to create things build a base and create items for you to use. I will admit the base building aspect of the game is impressive. You can build to your own imagination. The thing I do not like about it is the community is pretty toxic and your base can easily get raided and destroyed. It is hard to get started in this game because the already developed players can wipe you clean with no trouble. I suppose it adds to the difficulty aspect of the game but I was not a fan of it. There are many places to explore. I like all the structures you can investigate and loot. Rust may be for some people who enjoy hardcore survival games but my experience with it was unsatisfactory.,Rust

This is an amazing game and is amazingly fun with friends and even solo but you have to be willing to put in alot of time and effort even some days. it is better to start with friends but you must learn how to survive on your own or else you probibly wont be the best but if thats fine with you do it. 10/10 Amazing game buy if you have time and or willing to try over and over.............oh yea btw the community is toxic af REEEE Danit0,Rust

Ofc it's mostly the devs fault because there isn't much to do than building and raiding. The trade option is a good point.Dumb AI dumb physics (for example animals can run up on surfaces where players can't. No demolition hammer if you misplace something. Can't rotate the objects during placment you have to run around.Itt ragadnám meg az alkalmat hogy üzenjek a kis szaros ""lelőlek geci helyben mert megtehetem"" emberkéknek Attól hogy így játszotok nem lesztek többek csak kevesebbek.

Some mechanics got better some are gone or got worse. New monuments? Yes.Better AI? Slightly yes. Is there anything else to do? No. Build check the new monument(s) kill or get killed raid or get raided maybe hide in a mine.

427693,2018-10-25,0,0,894,False,Recommended,"Okay so i realize i havent made a review on either of the accounts I have this game on so im gonna make it on this one.My main account has about 300 hours on rust and this one 850hours at the time i write this comment.Sooo lets start out with the bad1) The game is absolute dog if you are by yourself (vanilla) modded servers make this better but at the end of the day you will probably get ganged up on by 4 people when ur farming on vanilla and get offlined. If you're new to the game i'll give you some advice to start off with. Go to /r/playrust LFG or whatever its called and find a noob friendly group that you can play with so you can learn more about the game while also having your own little team going.2) Repetitive game It its old much like every other game out there when you play it for a while considering how i have so many hours on the game it got rather old and stale over time. I have recently begun to play it again pretty often due to the amount of content that the devs have added to the game.3) Lag This game just like a lot of others gets lag at times for what seems to be no reason this could be you rubber banding back when your internet is completely fine or your frames becoming absolute dog out of nowhere. Since my computer doesnt have the best parts out there i will just assume its because i have out of date tech on my pc.4) ""Survival"" This game i really dont consider to be a survival game like a lot of people say... its more like a loot hoarding pvp game which is fine but really i just dont see it as survival. This is just a personal thing i guess5) ""Toxic community"" As number 4 states this game is pretty much a pvp loot hoarding game which means if you are a new player to a server and you just wanna make a base RP or whatever the hell you do you're in for a bad time. You will be pretty much KILLED ON SIGHT by literally anyone that sees you unless you are on a server that has a rule against KOS. Now even I can agree that the community of this game is toxic. Filled with hacking korean zergs dumb 10 year olds and just plain out s.. I believe they tried to counter KOS by adding a sash on your back if you have had a weapon or tool in your inventory but it seems that didnt do much of anything considering how people still KOS when you have no sash or loot on your body. People kill you just to be flat out I generally dont kill nakeds unless they are near a fight and may snag some loot or they are just me off. But some people do it as a big ""lol u naked"". So yes i would say that its a toxic community (most players at least)6) H a c k e r s Just dont ing go on a facepunch server please.The Good1) Content constantly being added and changed Ever since i first bought this game I always thought that it was cool how the rust team was always working on stuff to be in the game. They try to add more things like new events like the boats new items and ways to get loot etc.2) Interactions When you arent KOS'd on rust and you talk to people its a pretty good experience and usually you will have a good time until some geared guys kill you. People in this game can usually give me a good laugh when i meet them on the beaches and but thats probably just because they have nothing.. once they get a spear they will shove it into ur head more than likely. If you want to have more conversation or just talk there are places like the safezones you can run to and sometimes have a decent time in if you find other people in them.3) Pvp When the pvp works correctly and doesnt lag its a very good experience. Every weapon you use can be something you can make a play with a sword a spear etc all of these weapons you can kill someone geared with and snowball if you wanted to try it out. 4) Modded servers If you are a casual player like some and dont like the constant grind and bs you have to deal with to get to top tier modded servers offer things for people like you. Rust offers 2x 3x 5x even 1000x servers that just give you a lot more than Vanilla servers do. There will be less grind but more pvp in these servers usually. Most experienced players i've talked to dont like modded including myself so if you're solo or duo and just wanna get some quick loot join a 2x or a 3x they will be more friendly if you're newer to the game.5) Feeling Rust gives me a feeling that most other games cant do and thats when they just make my adrenaline flow fast as hell. When you are close to the nice snowball that you've been dreaming for.. no meds all teammates dead and just one more mag and that adrenaline pumps i just love that it makes me hard as hellOverall Rust for me personally is a 8 out of 10 It isnt really perfect at all with the lag and but it is a good game at the end of the day. The work they put into this game over the years has turned out to be in my opinion a great game.",Rust

After that when I respawned at a different beach a man wearing trash and cloth was screaming really loud and making weird noises. I looked in front of him from a distance and saw a bear attacking him. Without hesitation I lunged towards the bear with my rock and bashed it s head. But the bear wasn t done yet. It fought back and knocked me to the ground. Just as I thought I was about to die. I heard gun shots and saw the bear fall to the ground. I was picked up by the man in cloth and trash. He thanked me and took me to his base where he fed and healed me. He asked if I was new to the game and I said yes. He said I could stay with him until the end of the wipe. I went to sleep that night feeling accomplished in Rust. I woke up the next day excited ready to play Rust.I loaded the game and joined the server greeted by a a screen saying I was dead and I was killed by a semi automatic rifle. I didn t play Rust for a while after that until I learnt more about the game and found out what happened to me in the base was called getting raided.Toxic community savage bears and wolves. Just a great game especially with friends. 10/10,Rust

427729,2018-11-26,0,0,796,False,Recommended,This game has a very sharp learning curve and can be very frustrating. At 600 hours I'm still learning how to play! Facepunch is doing a great job adding content with monthly updates and the developers actually listen to the community with some of those additions. Rust can feel very repetitive but something about it draws me back in every time.It is especially fun to play with friends and definitely gives you an edge in PVP situations. It is still playable solo and there are servers that only allow groups of up to one two or three players on a team if you're having trouble on vanilla where it is very likely you will come up agrainst a group of five ten or possibly even more players. I play as a solo or in a duo most of the time and the moments where you come out on top are definitely worth the struggles in my opinion.I wouldn't really recommend the game if you can't dedicate a lot of time to it since you need to constantly harvest materials to maintain your base. And the larger your base the more materials you need to harvest. You can find yourself playing for hours get some gear get a base down then you log off to get some rest. You go to school or work or whatever else you do during the day then you log back on and you've lost everything. Right back at square one. It can be very frustrating but some people enjoy that.However there are modded servers that speed up or remove the not so fun grinding process of the game which can also be very fun to do. There are so many different servers with different levels of modifications that can improve the game for people who don't have much time to game.,Rust

427744,2018-10-11,0,0,243,False,Recommended,Hundreds of hours in and I'm still enjoying Rust. I enjoy the continual updates this games has gotten over the years as the develpment team is always working to improve the game. Rust's crafting system is solid and the loot drops are pretty fair making it not too difficult to get your base up and running.Although I do reccomend this game that reccomendation does come with a few caveats. For me rust is a mainly co op game. The majority of players you'll meet will be hostile or toxic. They'll usually kill on sight making it difficult to go alone. For this reason I mainly will play with friends. Fortunately I have met many players that are willing to work together which helps make the game more enjoyable especially if you're playing on your own.With all that being said Rust is a fantastic survival game offering a solid PVP experience as well as interesting roleplaying opportunities.,Rust

One other dislike that i had is how toxic the community is at least with launge and among being very hostile all the time there still is some acctually decent people in the game.Another great thing about this game is that there constently doing resets to give a level playing field as well as there is a veriety of things that can be crafted.,Rust

However the community is toxic and its almost impossible to set up a house so it will ruin your day. Making any actual progress is relieving but its a brutal survival sim and instead of the focus on getting gear and tech its simply staying alive. No matter how much you have you are always at risk of losing it all to some weaboo neckbeard or salty 9 year old.Great game but community ruins it play with friends or play very safe if you wanna have fun in the slightest.,Rust

427834,2018-11-25,0,0,1465,False,Recommended,Honestly this game is a roller coaster of emotions there's vanilla servers which have 0 mods added nothing to help you in gather things faster which is nice but I don't recommend being solo on them or if you do start out as solo then get a friend or friends then there's modded servers these servers can vary you have servers where you can gather resources 2 10 times most servers above 3x are there to help you around the game then you have aim training and battlefield servers the servers mainly to help you control spray paterns these servers are great if you want to get better in the game.I recommend this game to people who don't get frustrated easily and for people that are okay with losing progress that you've put hours into this game is about gaining and losing there's s all over but sometimes you meet nice people which you begin a great experience with. If you buy this game good luck in the buttnaked world,Rust
427835,2018-03-01,0,0,317,False,Recommended,Do I recommend this game?Yes!Rust is a unique open world survival FPS in which you must survive against many other players and NPCs.Imagine this...You wake up on a beach shore naked with just a rock and a torch and whatever you do next is up to you. You don't know who you are or why you're here but you have one goal SURVIVE AT ANY COST. You wander around collecting resources gaining valuable items and finally make a little base. You slowly upgrade your arsenal from spears and bows to more modern weapons such as revolvers and basic rifles.As you explore more and more you stumble upon other people some friendly and some not. Whether you befriend them or not is up to you...Now I'm gonna get all technical.This game has lots of pros It's open ended making gameplay and replayability basically endless. As of writing this I have spent over 200 hours in this game and I definitely haven't explored all possible outcomes of playing.The general community isn't the best but if you play with friends and make allies the game is much more enjoyable and less grindy.The weapon physics and movement system is pretty good in my opinion with gunfights being very skill based and rather realistic.The devs are very in touch with the community posting weekly community updates and constantly informing players of the future of the game. That alone to me is very important and I respect how much time and effort is put into each update.Now the cons The biggest con to me is how unrewarding the game is in the long run. Each month all progress from the past is wiped whether you want it to be or not.Now while this is useful for server/player balancing it's just an unfortunate event that happens.One other thing that deters me from playing is how grindy the game can be. Rust isn't a game where you stop by and play for an hour then be done because you can't get much done in such a short amount of time. If you are wanting to truly play Rust you are going to need lots of time to be able to play the game to it's full potential.Optimization is also a problem. You don't neccessarily need an extremely powerful pc to be able to play but Rust demands a lot of processor and graphics card power. Luckily optimization is constantly being improved to the point that I have gained over 30 fps since I started playing Rust less than a year ago.One last thing. If you've never watched any content over Rust I definitely suggest you take a bit of time to understand what you are about to get yourself into. The Rust experience is very hard and unforgiving and playing without any knowledge is extremely difficult. Expect to die...a lot.Conclusion If you like open world survival games this is right up your alley...Just make sure you have the time and patience to play!Wyl33 J's Rating 8/10,Rust

427837,2018-11-25,0,0,238,False,Recommended,This is the point where the game starts to drop. The toxicity of the community can make newer players upset about the fact that whenever they try to kill a good player they just get called a terrible player and they're 'trash'. Again this can make bad players really demotivated and not want to play on servers with players who know what they're doing. You could be doing so well and then get double teamed by a bunch of people with SAR's and then they would trash talk you while you bleed out infront of them. This is pretty annoying but after awhile it becomes kind of a natural thing to happen. You don't want this to happen to you. There's rarely anymore kind players and everyone just wants to trash talk other people and try to look good at the game. For a person that only started to play a week or two ago I've began to understand that RUST is a game about skill and if you don't know how to control the AK47 spray there's not much for you in a modded server or vanilla. I learned fairly quickly about the AK spray and quite frankly I really enjoy the game in some parts. I wouldn't find anything being grindy (except for component farming which gives a chance of you to lose everything and then start over again). Other than that. This game is pretty fun but there's still cons for new players.,Rust

427842,2018-11-21,0,0,154,False,Recommended,"Although the community is pure toxicity and ""cancer"" I would say without a doubt that this is an amazing game. My favorite things about the game are Constant developer support for the game meaning new updates and new content quite often. Great to play with friends and with the new party feature it is easier to do so. Many items and features in the game. Huge amount of servers to choose from server support is well developed on Rust. PvP is plentiful it's almost impossible to become bored when there is always constant looting and killing and exploring to do. (not to mention raiding although it isn't really worth it.)I currently have a few complaints about the game mainly involving how the servers and community behave Toxicity is everywhere if you are faint of heart or one of those ""special overprivileged snowflakes"" then this isn't the game for you. Clans will dominate you clans are everywhere and if you don't submit they will take care of you easily. Zergs (massive groups of people who attack together) are common it's the same story as the clans but they are more violent and hostile. Game optimization is very poor even if you have a good pc you will have a hard time running this game at 60FPS at all times on the highest graphics or even medium graphics. Very high difficulty curve it's not easy to play the game and get good at it if you don't dedicate enough time. Although I haven't encountered too many cheaters due to my low play time I've noticed that people complain of hacking and cheating in the game a lot and it is true there are quite a few hackers and cheaters in the game.Most of my complaints are based upon the community and the servers themself not really against the game. If you feel like that there should be anything else added to my list then feel free to comment. Overall I highly recommend buying Rust despite the price being raised I think it is worth it. Especially compared to other games in the same category for higher prices.",Rust

427910,2018-03-17,0,0,107,False,Not Recommended,"First let's talk about what is good about Rust.Decent Progression The current progression system in Rust is based around obtaining both scrap and blueprints from looting and using scrap in order to create blueprints at a research table learning the blueprint and finally allowing you to craft the item at the correct level workbench. While the system does have it's problems (which I wil talk about in the cons section) overall I like the concept of having to take time to find and unlock better items. It adds a bit more of a sense of direction to the game that before it was added was missing.Okay now that's we've talked about what's good we can get to all the things that are bad.First and foremost... The community is toxic as all hell I'm not joking I don't think I have ever seen a more toxic community in a game in my entire life. Almost every person you encounter will try to kill you regardless of how gear you are and regardless of how geared they are. There are servers where extremely geared player will literally just sit at the spawn points and shoot you every time you respawn. Heck I've even been on servers where other nudies (fresh spawns) will sit and spawn camp the other nudies... for literally no reason there is nothing to gain from killing nudies. You'd be hard pressed to find a single official server that does not include almost all of the following Fly hackers Aim botters Griefers who raid your base and then lock you out of it... not take it for use just make sure you can never use it again Massive clans that take over the entire server and relentlessly hunt down any new players until they quit the game People who wait until you log off to raid your base because they're too cowardly to do it while you're online Tons of racial slurs Tons of koreans and russians who speak no English in the slightest (on US servers)A zerg clan that has full metal armor and AKs 5 hours after wipe while you're still trying to build a base.The community of rust is just on a never ending downward spiral of toxicity. The toxicity makes the casual players quit which only leaves the toxic player remaining so when you join a server it's almost guarunteed that every player on it is the most toxic person you've ever seen. People who take pride not in a fair fight or in having fun or even in the sense of accomplishment of beating an equally skilled opponent but in attacking people while they can't defend themselves killing griefing and raiding not because they need supplies or because you are a threat but simply because they know it pisses you off.The base upkeep system The current base upkeep system was added by facepunch in order to combat zergs and large clans. Does it actually do this... hell no. The current upkeep system does nothing more than hinder casual and solo players. The way the system currently works is that once a base is built a tool cupboard (TC) must be placed which covers an area and only allows those who are authorized in it to build any higher than twig level inside of the protected area). The TC then requires a certain amount of resources every day in order to keep your base from starting to decay. The type and amount of resources is based on what the base is made of and how big it is. The more people who are connected to the TC the higher the resource cost. If the base ever gets damaged after ten minutes of no damage the TC will use even more of the supplies stored in it to repair the damage. Once the TC runs out of supplies your base begins to decay. Once the decya begins you can expect your walls to be destoyed in 3 hours and your entire base to be destroyed in around 6 hours.Now that you know how it works allow me to explain all of the massive problems with it. First off the upkeep costs are so astronomically high that it's near impossible for solo or casual players to upkeep their bases. A simple 3x3 3 story base (which in rust is a rather small base) costs 40 000 stone per day to upkeep which is around 3 4 hours of mining just to be able to upkeep your base. This makes it near impossible for any casual or solo players to play as they will have to spend almost all of their time just preventing their base from falling apart. Also you know how I said that a 3x3x3 stone base costs 40k/day to upkeep? Well the TC only has 18 slots and there are onlt 1k stones per slot so that means a completely full TC can upkeep your base for a whopping... 11 hours... not even a full day. The way the current upkeep system works either you have a ridiculously small base that is easy pickings for any clan or you have a larger base that you have to essentially fill every couple of hours... people who have school or work amirite?Another problem with this system has to do with that whole ""the TC repairs the base using the stored resources"" part. This causes a massively overpowered exploit where a clan can essentailly come to your base and instead of having to seach for the rooms in your honeycombed base the contain the loot they simply have to damage the exterior walls wait for them to repair and repeat this process until they've bled your TC of all it's stored resources and then just wait 3 hours for all of the walls in your base to break and it's looting time. So in short the upkeep system does nothing but make it almost completely impossible to have a base unless you have a massive clan that has players online 24/7.The blueprint system Like I said above while I like the concept of the blueprint system there are massive problems with it's application in Rust... first off... everything is FAR to expensive. First off there are three ways to get scrap the first is by breaking barrels which typically gets you 1 2 scrap per barrel. The second is crates which get you around 5 scrap per crate. Finally the high level chest can typically get you anywhere from 20 50 scrap. Now just to make the research table and all 3 workbenches you need 1 875 scrap which is either roughly 1 250 barrels 375 crates or roughly 60 70 high level chests (which only spawn in the hardest areas of the game). This is just a downright absurd price for this stuff and that's just the stuff to research and build stuff with that's not counting the actual research costs. Want to be able to research a hoodie? That's 75 scrap. A pickaxe? That's another 75. An assault rifle? Pfft 750 scrap please. A chair whos only purpose is decoration... 20 scrap.The costs are downright absurd. A simple hoodie should not take an hour of farming to unlock when the servers wipe once a month.The servers wipe once a month Now I understand why this was a thing back in early access Facepunch needed to wipe servers in order to put out updates... but the game is in full release now server owners should be allowed to decide how long their servers will gow before a wipe. It's virtually impossible for any solo or casual player to make any significant progress before the servers get wiped every month.Cont. in comments",Rust

Do not buy this game... All it has too offer is boring and imbalanced gameplay and a toxic community of players. As for the boring part all you do is farm nodes then blow up someone's base for their loot and all of your hard earned progress is ""wiped"" away. As for the imbalanced part a group of 2 people with light gear and submachineguns can take out a man with an assault rifle and heavy gear. No skill for this game. No fun for this game.

With a group Rust is great fun messing around but solo on vanilla can be pretty difficult.

427995,2018-08-21,0,0,1878,False,Recommended,The best multiplayer survival game this world has to offer but the devs cant seem to get it through their thick skulls that their game is dying not because the game isn't noob friendly but because they don't want to fix optimization/Bugs that leave your character standing still in the middle of a fight. Also the hackers that roam freely on official servers that when they get banned they come back within 10 mins on a new account with the same name. Community servers are great for keeping hackers off but those servers are slowly dying out or becoming solo/duo/trio servers also the admins on community servers are sometimes gun ho with banning when you might be a little too good.Me and my friends had this problem only twice but its still an issue. I've played this game since legacy and i've loved it since. In conclusion the game is a great game if you can look past the issues and play with friends you like. P.S.

It's a bit tricky to learn everything but once you get the hang of crafting and building the game is much smoother! Also there are a lot of things you have to grind for which I find kinda fun and realistic. It's worth the price especially with the winter sale they have on this! However you might crash or lag a lot if you have the graphics set on 'Fantastic!' so I recommend lowering them before you go into the game.

Start with the small things. Chop trees gather stone and build a base maybe. What's you're goal now? Pvp. Fight for mass amount of loot in populated zones to build your empire.

This doesn't fully switch up the whole flow of the game but instead adds little hints of new things to explore experiment with and master. This isn't your typical survival game. There is always going to be a new experience around the corner. &lt 3 Facepunch,Rust

I've just recently put 100 hours into the game and it's still just as fun as when I first jumped into a server. I've been chased by naked men and women and been chased by full geared guys with Ak47s. If you've been looking for a game that you can play over and over this is it. If you're looking for a game to make friends on this is it. If you're looking for a game to make enemy's on this is it. If you like staring at a rock for 30 minutes everytime you die this is for you. 10/10 rust life&gt real lifeEdit Now I'm nearing almost 400 hours and I can still whole heartedly say this is my favorite game on steam.

428124,2016-03-05,0,0,93,True,Recommended,Rust is simply a fantastic game. Garry and his team are always updating content on a weekly basis and the gameplay mechanics continue to improve. Rust is a surivival style game and only playable with other players online. It's an awesome team or solo experience and you will sure make some enemies playing.Pros Vanilla servers are well optimized for low end PC's. Variety of procedurely generated terrain including snow grass mountains streams lakes and forests. Good early game and end game items and weapons. Great FPS mechanics. Regular updates based on community feedback. Base building is highly customizeable. Raiding is very fair for both parties requires skill and planning. Great hunting and crafting mechanics. Modded servers with gamemodes like The Hunger Games You can master crappy items and use them to kill unskilled geared players You can starve to death freeze to death be mauled fall to your death be quickscoped by a rock burn and really die any way possible. Everything is out to kill you! It's spooky at nighttime and you can sing campfire songs.Cons Abundance of cheaters on modded rust servers. Decay is rather fast so bases can disappear after a few days of inactivity. Dead bodies of animals and players glitch through the floor. Community is generally pretty savage.Overall Rating 9/10Worth the Price YesLike surival games? This is the best. This game is not very welcoming of new players but with a little practice it's quite fun. It's best played with friends but solo is always really fun too.,Rust

There aren't enough servers and not to mention that they lag a lot. Clans have it too easy in this game. Solo survival chance is lower than me getting a girlfriend. Yeah it's that low. Researching stuff takes too much effort. It is so much that you reincarnate multiple times to achieve an adequate level of wisdom.

This game is very loved and is always trying to be improved upon even after release. Wait for deals but don't pass it up if you're into goofy survival (with others) and optional raiding aspects depending on the server you want. PVE is available and really cool mods. If the base game doesn't have what you're looking for someone else has made it. (Or... you could always try to make it or smth... idk lmao)It's one of my favorite MMOs (my favorite games in general are single player).Heads up though.

I have put enough hours in to feel that I have a fair view of the gameplay. Lets start out by saying you may be somewhat mortified that this game is fun to you. Why you ask? The short answer is that if you feel bad about killing naked people simply trying to chop a tree or pick a rock or waiting until someone has put in a bunch of hard work so that you can kill them and take their stuff you have choices. Dont Play. Become a Victim or the more popular option victimize you fellow humans while chortling that the tweleve year old you killed is raging about it and hoping you family dies in a fire. The thing that makes the game the most fun and the least fun is the player base. I have made great friends and some pretty distingushed enemies. I have also delt with what many consider to be one of the most toxic communities you can encounter. That being said I have still played this game and enjoyed almost every second of it. Game play is pretty simple and very intuitive. The tech tree is overly simple and provides a significant advantage to the players who log in and invest time after a server wipe. Due to this the servers with the highest population wipe weekly if not twice a week. As a whole servers that dont do this will see their player base drop off to almost nothing withing the first few days.,Rust

428321,2018-11-21,0,0,251,False,Recommended,Hi there! My name is TheLastWarlord (as of posting this.) If anyone follows me on Steam you will know I am a heavy survival game player (Noone loves me so I doubt that) Anyway I just got rust a few years ago but I finally decided to play it. When I got in what do I get? Toxic players and a shotgun to my face. Is this bad? Up to you to decide.Rust is a straight PvP game with alot of young teenagers that play it thinking their hot stuff (me included) In reality it is the hardest game I have played but also the most addicting. I'd have to say grab a group of 3 4 friends and make a clan and harvest away!PROSThe pros? Well for one the graphics and sound. Depending on your computer they can be really good. I think the sound is the better of the two. This game is really heavily reliant on sound to determine where your enimes are picking hatcheting shooting etc. Is super loud but so are footsteps. So make sure your house is quiet turn up game sounds and enjoy. (Just kidding ignore my terrible advice lol. Keep your ears intact) Another pro is the resource gathering. This includes but is not limited to tools mats (Materials for you non survival players) and meds. Mining barrels is a sure fire way to get guns ammo armor and building mats. I personally think this is an amazing idea some think different.CONSToxic community I have to say it. Every once in awhile you'll run into a nice player but that is rare. I'm not saying the whole community is toxic but most are either quiet (Again nothing wrong with that) Really talkative too trustworthy or just outwright toxic. These are just personal cons for me don't take these too seriously. Hackers. Facepunch doesn't really help with this either. They are so common on Offical servers that everyone except the occasional noob and hacker goes on there. I play on a 20x that wipes every Thursday and I see almost 1 hacker a wipe. The admins usually take care of them but still nuts right?That is about it for my review. What is my overall thought? I wrote this as positive but tbh it can be both for me. Don't take this review too seriously as it is just me posting my thoughts on the game just to let you know how this game is anyway thanks for taking the time to read this ),Rust

428359,2018-11-28,0,0,137,False,Recommended,Overall game is very good.Pros A lot of people are complaining about cheaters in any PC game which is competitive the game has cheaters ( didn't encountered not a single one in 130+hours of play ) but the company really cares about the game and banning actively them. They ban them in such a way that to return to the game is very difficult or costly meaning 1 banned cheater is gone he will not return for a while. Game very competitive and addictive has a lot of content had so much fun playing and very interested in streamers who stream the game. Developers are updating the game constantly every month they are presenting new features its like monthly Christmas you know that some big update will arrive and it actually changes the game and makes it better. The game has modded servers it means that if you want some different things you can easily join modded servers. ( For example if you want only to build you can join building servers same goes with PVP or anything you can think of ) Best survival game that exists to this day. Don't trust anyone who has 2 legs Involves skill you can't buy anything for money which will make you better it's not pay to win game it requires time ( much more time than i have 130+ hours ) and patience. Overall more you play you get better not your weapons or character.Cons The game badly needs optimization I have very high end PC and the game has FPS drops watched a lot of videos played with settings but didn't fixed the problem. This game badly needs optimization. Some bugs are there for months for example the bug where you can't pick up item because body is on top of the item and you need to remove body in order to pick up gun this is very annoying because sometimes you don't have even 1 second to waste. And other bugs which I checked are reported to facepunch studios. The game badly needs huge advertisement campaign to attract more people to the game I mean this game is the best survival game that exists and the same time sometimes servers are not full and lack people i understand that there are thousands of servers but the player base can be increased dramatically with the right advertisement. The game has so much content and for the beginner its pretty hard to understand everything how to do certain things i love that there was helping tips but its not enough.Overall If you like survival style games this is a MUST play game There is no better game than this in survival genre. BUY IT.,Rust

428363,2015-12-27,0,0,793,True,Recommended,Going from having everything you can ever imagine too nothing in under 10 minutes? Yeah we call that rust. EDIT DEC 2018 As of December 2018 I thought I would write an updated review of the game in a shortish form. Lets just say that Rust has changed while still being the same game deep down personally I don't like the scrap system they put in but I'm getting used to it (my favourite was still blueprints from a couple years back).The game revolves around you starting out with nothing you must gather resources to build a base make weapons and armor as well as venturing out to collect other resources for scrap to get the blueprints for new and better items to make all while being hunted down by up to hundreds of other players. Very intense and fun game and I find it never gets old but can really be ruined by the community of certain players which isn't the games fault.All in all the game is fun and while you are doing the same thing over and over each time its different in certain ways making the replay value after each map wipe very high. The devs are very involved in the game and are constantly adding new things and fixing the old. One of my favourite games.Also don't expect to be very good at the game unless you play it quite a bit steep learning curve here get some friends to teach you how to play or else you are doomed. Rust can be a full time job if u wanted it to be.,Rust

428413,2018-11-22,0,0,829,False,Recommended,Being honest don't come into this game expecting people to be nice to you. The community is so toxic and I love it. This game has given me the ability to grow above players and join a clan that runs the server. I do recommend playing this game IF and IF ONLY you have the requirements. This game is VERY demanding and with each new update the developers add more content to the game. Though at times it may be hard and boring but is fun when you get guns and start to gain wealth in the server. Knowing your base may not be there the next day you need to gain more resources and materials to build up your base and defenses. I would personally give it a 9.5/10. I can barely run the game due to the updates that have been added but I do recommend you play this game. Thank you for reading this D,Rust

428435,2016-03-14,0,0,2857,False,Recommended,Game is fun and all. Rampant with hackers the superjumpers and brute forcers make light work of your structures without needing a single resource. The private servers seem to be better policed for hacking than the offical facepunch servers which is kind of sad. Would be a fun game without the rampant hacking.Update almost 2k hours definately the best survival sandbox game i've played. As before still hackers but with an EA game i guess it's generally easier to do. The XP system was a bit of a flop but thankfully they realised this and introduced the component systems not quite bps again yet a great improvement on the XP system. I returned for a month to check out the compnent system and had great fun. Recommended to anyone who likes surivival games. Tip Rust is brutal alone.UPDATE 11/08/17 It still has it s positives and is a bit of fun though have spent a lot of hours on this game and the devs have no clear path. They chop and change things constantly. Now I get it it's EA but complete system changes to poorer systems only to then change them again is a joke. The lack of actualy decent updates anymore and simply cosmetic fixes and looking skins being pumped out for extra cash. They first destroyed legacy rust now they are well and trully on the way to destroying experimental branch as well. Quit while you are ahead Garry.......... If you wanted to around with every little aspect of a game to make it sandbox you already have Garry's Mod you and your team have en sunk this one sadly.,Rust

But that fact that the creators do a poor job of explaining how to play and what to actually do is garbage. If you never had any experience with games like these dont download and waste your money. unless you want to spend hours just learning how to get food. The game also has a completely and stupid hard time to start because there are so many players on every server you cant even get wood without getting chased from a 10 year old kid and die because you run into another way. The would be good but the devs are just to lazy to put in the time of making a way for new players to get used to the game such as a server that would only let the people who have under 10 hours enter so that they could figure out how to play the dam game they just spent $30 dollars on.,Rust

428498,2018-01-09,0,0,1319,True,Not Recommended,AS of right now i dont recommend this game at all. you can play on a small server rather peacefully but also it becomes incredibly boring incredibly fast. Play on a more populated server and get s KOS'ing you every time you spawn and the cancer community on rust will even go as far as to try to trick people into thinking their trustworthy. Even if you're a naked with not one item of value almost everyone on rust will kill you laugh in your face talk you and spread toxicity about the server youre on the second you say anything about the fact they KOS. even though its ed up they use the excuse 'its rust'. NO. it being a cutthroat survival game means pvp and gunfights and raids of course but it should also mean working together kindness loyalty and other things that in my opinion a survival game should have. people shouldnt be able to kill nakeds as a naked you spend hours just trying to get a base up only to continuilly be killed by people who claim that you can trust them and when they betray you the classic trademark excuse comes up and thats 'its rust stop crying'. really so because its rust anyone at any time can completely you. and then humiliate you turn an entire server against you grief your base and so much more and get away with it and have it be called a fun game? um excuse me. atleast pubg is fair. they start you out with gear so youre all on a level playing field with wipes sure youre even for a bit but its all about luck and who gets what blueprints and if you can find enough components. in the end this game just becomes a massive pile of cancerous not because of the gameplay but because of everyone who plays being completely cancer. i havent playedfor super long but just the fact EVERYONE so far has betrayed me i know the people of rust have no moral compass and beyond that they dont even mind trying to hurt you irl. By saying some of the most rude things they can possibly think of and often times screaming in the mic and saying offensive racist or sexist terms. the people of rust are immature and quite frankly have played rust for way too long or are wayy too thrilled with KOS'ing. Dont get this game for your children ever. and if youre thinking of buying it wait till it goes on sale. its community is so garbage right now its unenjoyable.Bear in mind as well on this server i was on where i was still getting killed on sight there were only about 15 people on the server. its a friendly to noobs server as well and even on those you have a dude with an AK who kills me while naked and proceeds to spam chat about how im like 11 and im crying cus he KOS'd a naked. he didnt just KOS. he lured me over by saying he wouldnt kill me. as an innocent naked at that time i then knew dont play rust unless you want everyone to on you from the second you spawn and stab you in the back if you ever even do make friends. TL DR The community is cancer unless you enjoy being reamed by everyone you meet.,Rust

428507,2016-10-16,0,0,1553,True,Recommended,Rust is a survival game created by Facepunch Studios. Inspired by games like DayZ Minecraft and Stalker Rust aims to create a hostile environment in which emergent gameplay can flourish. The aim of the game is to survive. To do this the player should gather resources. Hitting a tree with a rock will give you wood hitting a rock with a rock will give you rock and ore. You can then craft a hatchet from the wood and rock allowing you to gather faster. You can go out and hunt a variety of wildlife such as boars chickens rabbits bears wolves and deer. Once you have killed an animal you can butcher it to gather its meat and skin. You can craft a fire using wood and cook the meat inside the fire. Then you can eat. You face two major dangers in game. Rust is a multiplayer game so there will be other players trying to survive in the same way that you are. Unfortunately for you they can find you kill you and take your stuff. Fortunately for you you can kill them and take their stuff. Or maybe you can make friends and help each other survive. Rust s world is harsh so you might need to make friends to survive. The environment is not kind. Bears and wolves will chase and kill you. Falling from a height will kill you. Being exposed to radiation for an extended period will kill you. Starving will kill you. Being cold will kill you. I will kill you ),Rust

428509,2014-11-10,0,0,519,False,Recommended,"I bought this game twice last week for me and my friend and paid 28$. At first we didn't know about there's ""Legacy"" mode. So we played with Experimental and we really liked it. Then we looked at Legacy but after Experimental Legacy was not good enough for us. So i'm writing this for Experimental. We loved the environment physics interface and much more things of the game but ""connection problems"" are very very annoying. So we both stopped playing it. Here are the serious problems that we noticed We always disconnect suddenly from different servers and we don't know why. Sometimes when we try to get into a server the game freezes on loading screen. (Receiving data) I'm playing the game on Fantastic mode. But when i look at that huge trees' from a long distance their leaves and bodies look like blocks of glitchy little trees. There's a bug on the code lock. Sometimes it aparts from the door and freezes in the air. There's no options tab in the main menu.You guys should sell Legacy and Experimental seperately. And Experimental's price must be under 5$. We didn't want to pay for the game we'll never open and play.So I'm not recommending this game until the connection problems are resolved. We can handle other bugs but connection problems are not acceptable for a paid game.EDIT The game is better now. Recommended.POST EDIT This game is the best!",Rust

428516,2018-11-23,0,0,59,False,Recommended,Rust is an incredible game truly magnificent. Me and my friends have had hours building awful wooden bases only for them to be obliterated by a group of highly trained killers. Usually after this we are conscripted into some sort of army and used to wage war upon others like ourselves. Eventually the feelings of guilt and betrayal fade and are replaced only by a desire to please our overlords and bring death to their enemies. After several more hours of endless violence and bloodshed we stunble upon a few friends making a simple wooden shack. Tears flood our eyes as we remember our past and the journey we went on it to get here. We quickly put this out of our mind and mow them down like animals and then offer them a chance to join our glorious overlords army and they accept. the cycle continues....

428553,2016-11-25,0,0,762,False,Recommended,This game is possibly one of the best survival games out there with it's amazing graphics and game mechanics which really gives a feel of realistic survival especially with the base builder that allows for players to defend their loot and have other players attempt to raid it.The developers of this game are amazing as they are the only developers who actually listen to what the Rust community has to say and implement suggestions into the game compared to DayZ this game has better potential and has progressed more in the past few years unlike DayZ. However the downside of this game is that it does get repetitive and can have kind of a cartoony feel do it depends if you like it. Overall this is a great survival game that i have played since release and have watched this progress amazingly. I would highly recommend this game too someone looking for a challenge and wants to get into survival games don't buy DayZ for now.,Rust

428589,2018-08-10,0,0,1090,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. Before you scroll down and read the rest.. let me say one thing ""Rust is a high risk high reward type of game if you get salty every time you die.. then move along.. this game isn't for you""._______________________________General game informationThis game is a great example of a survival sandbox game. You can literaly do whatever the hell you wanna do. Do you wanna roleplay? Go for it. Do you wanna build stuff and let your creative mind blow of some steam? Go for it. Do you wanna murder another player in cold blood with your trusted rock? Go for it.Obviously there are populair ways (PVP) to play the game but when you spawn in this game.. naked and along on a beach.. armed with a rock and torch.. with nothing holding you back.. you will realise why you woke up on the beach in the first place._______________________________My experienceAt the time of writing this review i've been playing this game for hours. It started out with a mate of mine buying the game. I was watching him through some streaming software and I thought it looked fun. So I bought it.After figuring out the basics of crafting and resource gathering i started building a wonderful base. That base lasted for a full hour. Then we were severly punished for the flaws in our design by a more experienced player. This happened over and over and over and over again. At this point a lot of people lose interest in the game I didn't.For some reason I was determined to learn from my previously made mistakes and improve on them.This resulted in over 800 hours of gameplay._______________________________State of the GameWhen you invest a little into this game physically and emotionally.. you will run into people referring to ""Legacy"" being the best state of the game I disagree.The current version of Rust is a combination of two previously tested systems of the game.These are named The Blueprint system + The component system.Most Rust players will tell you that the blueprint system was the best system this game has ever seen. Over the last few years them tried different systems which generally didn't get any love.A week ago (at the time of me posting this review) They revamped the system to the one I mentioned earlier.The Blueprint system + The component system Aka the best system Rust has ever seen + new features of older failed systems revamped._______________________________The prosIf you use a microphone you will have the most fun and random interactions you have ever experienced.There's a lot of ways to express your creativity. Basebuilding gearsets drawing penisses on other peoples bases.There is no real endgame so you can set your own goals. Trust me when I say that those can be very rewarding.Its a great game for Youtube content (has profanity filter auto censoring nudes ect.)Its a great game for Twitch content (has a streamer mode to hide from streamsnipers has profanity filter auto censoring nudes ect.)As a big community that really loves the game but for the most part is filled with toxic players. (Like any other game these days)The game is constantly being developed. Weekly changes+additions with every patch.The game also has a great Dev team they are hardworking and very dedicatedThe consIt has a big learning curve. The first thing you need to do is join a empty server and start figuring stuff out cause on a populated server you will get punished for it.A lot of people KoS in the current state of the game which is fine for me cause im used to it. But if you are new it can be very offputting.The game has a very annoying memoryleak that will cause problems no matter how much GB you got in that godlike computer of yours. (they are working on it)Deciding on the correct server for you to join will directly affect how much fun the game is for you as a soloplayer.The official servers are terrible. There is hardly ever a admin in there to counteract a possible cheater. My advice Stick to the community servers.The game uses a day/night cycle. During the night it truly is pitchblack and you wont be able to see a thing. Unless you have Nvidia then you can just fire up the gamma and you'll be fine. Especially vs people that have a AMD graphics card. Its a annoying problem in the game thats currently being looked into._______________________________The future isn't set in stone.Well sorta. If you take a look at the facepunch website you will be able to see a roadmap. On this roadmap you will be able to find features and fixes they lined up for the game. Some will be added shortly and some will probably never see the light of day. Keep in mind the game is currently still early access and might change drasticly in a year. I've seen the game go through 3 4 different systems now. And all of them had fun aspects and negative ones._______________________________ConclusionIf you are still interested after reading all this definately buy the game. Over the time of me playing Rust I've had the most interesting interactions and the most fun experiences ive ever had in a game._______________________________I'm Currently trading rust items feel free to send offers to me!!https //steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner 892100980&amp token QzzjP36",Rust

428626,2018-11-23,0,0,702,False,Recommended,"Let me start by saying that i have never ever in all my years on steam felt the absolute need to find the button to post a review on any game. That's obviously not to say no other game is worth a review. But rust...this game has a bittersweet taste. And i mean that in the best way possible. This game is a metaphor for life in my opinion. There are times where you will get the end of the stick. But moreso this game can be very very rewarding.The first thing i'd like to capitalize on is it's RANDOMNESS of events. Not events scripted into the game per se. Lets put it like this. I was and am really still quite a noob. It took me awhile to learn this game.I could not find a single node of stone or a single hemp plant for like the first 50 hours. Do not let this discourage you. (also do not let being killed or raided discourage you. Do whatever it takes to get in on the action. Mess with people try to get involved with other players in some way shape or form). THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I CAN SAY is to figure out what you're supposed to be doing and work towards it. Explore. Just the other day i joined a new server and within 5 minutes i had a pistol. Ive walked into decayed bases and past dead bodies with tons and tons of great on them. The bigger message here is you can run and run and run around in this game for 8 hours getting killed while naked starving freezing burning..This pattern changes with persistence. You WILL eventually kill someone with something good or find a dead body/broken into base full of loot. Once you get that first guy full of rifles explosives great armor it will motivate you. This game can be unforgiving but if you try to fit into the environment of hostile players the same way youd fit in at a new school a job prison try to communicate with folks even if you get screwed over. if you keep roaming building and wathcing youtube videos on all the aspects of the game you'll be at least somewhat successful. and it will continue to increase your motivation to play this. dont let trolls get to you. brush it off man. Servers wipe clean and everyone's item blueprints theyve acquired to craft essential items wipe clean typically between 1 week and several months. servers wipe monthly the longest ive seen and 4 days lowest. i prefer monthly wipes because i like to build. justwiped is a website that shows what servers have just wiped structures/loot and blueprints. When you start out on a fresh wipe everyone starts from scratch and things get a chance to be fair for everyone again. You're going to lose your base on wipe cycle date. youll probably lose it eventually otherwise unless you're lucky or you/your team happen to be the type to dominate servers. i believe the game is pretty balanced. More balanced than a lot of survival games. The building isnt too grindy. not like ARK. you can throw down a decent sized base fairly quickly when you get used to the rhythym and find good locations to seek residence in. LONG STORY SHORT i play on monthly wipe servers for instance...i like to think of the beginning of each wipe as entry to a month long competition against the other folks in the server. It's a game of elimination. People spend the first few weeks all building up and fighting with more pitiful weapons and it can get pretty amusing. Id say after around the 2 week mark things really start getting more hostile day by day usually worst to try to farm on a weeknight unless you're slick with the pvp. Once theres 2 3 days left before a month wipe people start using all the resources theyve had stockpiled and youll hear nothing but gunshots and explosions all over. therell be non stop chaos and destruction. it sounds like the 4th of july and its just beautiful. we start with nothing build up defenses and hoard stuff and go out with a bang at the end of every wipe and it repeats. new location servers hit population cap again new people to make rage. i go back to the randomness of events. I can say that ive been geared up in great armor with some of the best guns and have been killed by someone chucking spears or lobbing arrows at me. Ive also been the naked player with a bow to get a kill on a guy in full armor with a gun. It's all about awareness of your surroundings and not letting anyone get the drop on you. Generally a veteran player in high tier gear will have the upper hand but i have seen so many scenarios play out with what some would believe was pretty absurd irony. If you just try to do good and keep a positive competitive attitude youll eventually start making off with hauls of loot here and there. If you get ahold of blueprints for good weapons and items being wiped off the map does not stop you from getting a few workbenches back up a research table and mostly insignificant amount of materials to start crafting more of most mid level weapons/items and get back in the fight somewhat at least. you can become king of the hill yourself in the blink of an eye. thats just how it happens in this game. i see so many reviews of people ing about this game. i have had many unique experiences. Ive never played a game where i felt happy disappointed adrenaline pumped and paranoid all in the same day. You always have a decision to make trusting other players you intersect with. you never know if this person will become your friend on steam 10 years from now or if theyll shoot you and take all your stuff. Preemptive strikes can either get you some good loot or can off some kid and get him to go get his team nearby and stomp you and your base out. So you need to choose your battles. Maybe not kill everyone but detect when someones going to do something and react first. always be ready to kill someone man. It's like life. you take risks and hope for the best outcome. you get maimed you revise your tactics and try again. This game might not be for everyone MAYBE. BUT!!if you go on youtube and watch a bunch of videos on this game for months like i did before you buy it you will know whether this game is for you or not. This game will some people off if they fail to see the bigger picture of it's intention. I have to admit though I've never been i have felt this short lived disappointment/frustration yes. But it wears off and i keep playing compulsively like im a teenager again. I'm happy for anyone who can learn to appreciate this game and accept that yes it can suck but ask yourself what you're doing wrong if your whole experience of the game has been negative and figure out how to change it. watch videos of ""salty rust kids"" and building/raid guides. find an item read up on it online. like many games rust is its own world and its like learning a new language. it is the world we live in but people dont hold back on being amusing irritating or just plain psychopathic. Bad day at work? make some 10 year old beg for their back and laugh at them. GOod day at work? go farm and make some trades joke with some people. Put on some thick skin and just raise hell. thats all else i can really tell you. Next to warcraft in it's prime battlefield games and a handful of other games this is one of the best games i believe has ever existed. Like any game there could always be something added to it that isnt and maybe never will be. Theres always room for improvement in any game but look...theres a reason people play this game for 7k hours. ill leave it at that. hopefully people read this long scatterbrained but i think informative post put in a detailed way i dont see a lot of reviews do",Rust

428643,2016-09-08,0,0,433,True,Recommended,Started on the XP System update. Coming from ARK Survival Evolved what that game does wrong this one does it absolutely right. There's no HUGE gap between veteran and starter players (a TREX vs a Crossbow low tier vs high tier damage etc) meaning you can get on a server and start raiding in a few hours instead of spending your playtime grinding. The farming/pickup rates are far more generous meaning you will actually feel like you've made some progress which also makes a vanilla solo run feasible.Basically it's a survival game that allows hardcore and casual players to cohexist. You can play this as casually as an fps and still make meaningful progress which saves you a lot of time for your other daily activities. It's not exhausting for the common player.Lastly and in comparison to ARK PvP in rust is all about your ability as a player rather than seeing which flying dinosaur has more health in a world where guns are useless and an individual is meaningless.It has a long way to go but its foundation is pretty solid.,Rust
428644,2018-12-18,0,0,256,False,Recommended,Got this game from my friend and only cost him $5 because of humblebundle I was confuse first how this game works I wonder around running the entire map but when I was tired being naked and getting killedo oneshot I tried to learn how to survive your first night and so on. I realize I suck at pvp so I went to modded servers (helps a lot) to connect to 1v1 or pvp to improve your aim and how the gunds and bow/crossbows works I enjoy this game and they are making this game for realistic I like the new ceiling light system instead of using low grade fuel.

428650,2017-03-09,0,0,515,False,Recommended,Rust Review I bought this game in Early Access almost a year ago. Since then the development of the game has been astounding. Performance used to be terrible and certain aspects of the game were broken. Now performance has increased greatly and the game has increased in quality as well. Positives This game has an awesome atmosphere. It really makes you feel like you are there. There is something cool about meeting strangers and building a community or just trading or talking. It really makes the game that much better. Progression feels good. Whether you make your first gun or your first base. It feels good. Complaints You need a good/great pc to run this. Because of issues and graphics this game needs a beefy pc to get any fps. The majority of the community will KOS. So if you plan to play I recommend you get some friends first. There are still issues with the game. It isn't polished and perfect so don't buy it for that. Should I buy it? I would say yes. It's a wonderful game that has provided thousands of hours of enjoyment to many people. It's a little rough around the edges but I enjoyed every hour that I put into it,Rust

428663,2018-11-22,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,This game has great potential it feels like but the garbage community ruins everything. There's essentially no way to get setup on a server everyone is out to kill on sight to defend themselves.

428664,2018-11-22,0,0,175,False,Not Recommended,This game ing sucks. I used to play it for a bit but the toxicity levels are just to high. It's literally the worst game on the planet with people roof camping KOS killing new spawns camping random spots. Ark is a way better game than this pile of I honestly hate this it's just like KNOCK KNOCK whos there ITS US THE ING DOORCAMPERS *10 hours later they still sit out there not even a joke*. This game back in the good times when you walked around talked no shooting on sight and only wanted to find friends took a turn because oh no here comes the Cs go playerbase which is abousutely toxic af. If we had to take a moment to classify this game it would be abousute Yes I may be salty but to be salty about people who just ing kill you the moment you spawn should be acceptable in any form. Rust is a great game without the playerbase. But to be honest the rust playerbase is an entire thing on it's own. People from several toxic games Cs go WoW CoD and many more just came and rolled in. Those games are entirely about PvP and in the first few years rust had little PvP that was the best times indeed and then the s came and ruined it all. They all formed something called the Rust Community the abousute worst thing to ever see. They took toxic inspiration from others and they took rage to another level. (lol imma feckin hypocrite) This game is not worth buying at all. Your braincells will die you will lose hope. GET MAD GET ANGRY I DONT WANT THESE DAMN LEMONS.

428700,2018-12-23,0,0,1444,False,Recommended,After almost 1.5k hours played this game i decided that i need to write the review couse a lot of ppl think that its just sh*t game but its not. Its only game that i played that much and i hope ill be able to double or triple the time i played in this game because yes its toxic when cheaters are in server or when 20ppl zergs lives next to u or their are alot of roof campers or doorcampers but this game is not only about pvping you can roleplay and a lot of ppl what i experienced last 300h starting too help more nakeds and specialy new players that ofc tell that thet new. Anywats i think that its the best survival game out rn because every wipe (every month or week) theres new map over 2yrs of playing never been in same map same with the day cycles every day in rust is different everyone does different things every day in rust. And yes iknow that those 100h of start in rust gonna be hell but that feeling when u done the wipe and didnt get raided u still have shed loads of loot its the best feeling and even better when u make tons of plays or even just meeting new ppl that are friendly. Even those that angry on me when i raided them they were friendly and we exanged the xmas gifts and still played they tried to raid me i defended sucesfully they still been friendly didnt talk trash on me. Over all i think that things like that bit of comunity that is friendly and even roplays makes this game worth my time and that feeling of pleasure when u complete wipe or make really good play anyways i think this game is best out in survival comunity REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,Rust

428738,2018-11-16,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,DO NOT GET ME WRONG!!! Rust's concept is great I personally love online co op open world survival games. However the horrible optimization drives me away from this game.I love the gameplay everything is great getting geared is a long but rewarding quest. The graphics look really fresh.All the other stuff is horrible though whenever I access my build menu (Q) and click on an item to craft it lags my game so hard for 0.5 1 second. This might not sound like a lot but this happens every time no matter what I do. This may be the fact that my 1060 6gb is the only thing not sufficient for the (recommended) settings for the game but if I have an i7 8700 and 16gb of RAM and the game runs at 65 80 FPS average (1080p) this really should not be happening.I also have completely random lag spikes for 1 2 seconds during game with no warning and for no particular reason and of course this pushes me away from the game.All in all I recommend this game to everyone that has recommended settings however that one component you don't have on there can cuck you (in my speculations).,Rust

428742,2017-08-29,0,0,1350,False,Not Recommended,Now that i have 1k plus hours in this game i feel obliged to write a review Therefore i will try my best to describe what this game is at its core and why it is on a steep downward trend.I bought rust on June 17th 2016 And it was a really buggy and unfinsihed game but a really fun one it had alot of depth within the crafting and the pvp aspects. In my opinion xp was the best system for rust because it was a linear system in which one doesnt level up by being with a clan and having them do everything for them (like it is now) you had to actually farm and do things in the game that would contribute to your personal level And even if 1 person grinded really hard for 1 day they most likely would have rockets or c4 mabye ak but no raiding materials in which most of this game is dependant on that depth in raiding and pvp. And from that change from xp to components it wasnt about skill anymore it was about how much manpower you could muster and the chinese dominated this (for some reason i actually dont know why) in turn from that alot of those clans (in rust we call them zergs most of the time) they would cheat and from that more people feel inclined to cheat from that to counter them and from them countering the cheaters they kill more people and they feel inclined to cheat and the cycle repeats. And from that a toxic community forms not from social contact but from who can horde the most stuff and have the biggest base or the biggest zerg. The developers of this game are blissfully blind of what is actually happening in their game which is really saddening because rust used to be my favorite game of all time but this rapidly changed with the updates they have been releasing. These updates have the intentions of the people AWFULLY wrong and in turn the player base it turning against the company FacePunch studio's for not listening to the consumer feed back and doing whatever the they want with the game. A great expample of this is the boat update in this update they added boats in which you can go on the water and get items this is all fine and dandy but they have no clue what the community wants everyone on reddit has ben BEGGING for a change to pvp and the guns in the game. But no they want to add boats hot air balloons electricity and a lot of other t no one asked for. Which in turn made the community even more toxic and making everyone not trust facepunch. Which is making me turn my review against this game i give this game a 4/10 it is painfully average because facepunch has their fingers up their not changing what the entire community really wants in this game.Helk please,Rust

Because of some douches everybody kills everybody. As an ex I was a fresh spawn on a new server and wanted to ask 2 guys i've met how is the server (lag players etc) and guess what. Instant bullet in my head. Another thing is that many people run it with low specs and miss all the beauty of this game. And most important play it with friends. Update Go on with updates ! ),Rust

428867,2015-06-06,0,0,1748,False,Recommended,So i have a love hate relationship with rust i've had some of the greatest moments i've ever had in gaming but also some of the worst. I've had wipes where i was raided 8 times in one week and others where i only died 5 times and dominated an entire official server. I've been playing this game over the course of 6 years and i've seen it from the days where you were hitting zombies with a hatchet on hapis to where we are today. Unfortunately rust in its current state well it's very time consuming almost too time consuming. I can't say i was a fan of the upkeep update because well your base decaying with the fact you also fall asleep in game when you log off just kind of forces you to play almost everyday. You constantly have to worry about losing everything. You will find yourself at work thinking about how your base is holding up. It's just really obnoxious and i know some people will say that oh hey why don't you play on a 2x server and to that i say it ruins the balance. People get explosives and very high tear way too quick and since there's only so much space in a tc you bases defence is weakened while your enemies offense is doubled which is problematic. I think that the tc should at the very least have more space so if you slapped by real life you can just grind a bunch and fill your tc to hold you over for like 3 days and maybe have the space in your tc scale with the size of the building so it's still going to be expensive to upkeep if its too big but you can keep is up for 72 hours since people get busy and can't be on every day to grind. Another big thing is give people at the low tear more options to kill heavily geared opponents. The thing is if it's 1 or maybe two heavily gear guys you can take them out with a pipe if your really smart about your positioning and if they come to you. The only other option that comes to mind is if you use a crossy and three stone spears which if you have never tried it is a load of fun to use. It's really effective though because you can headshot with the crossbow and then follow up with three spears to the head and kill well anything. The problem is that well you have the groups of five patrolling with ak and road sign and if they are even a challenge for one dude with metal armor and an ak. It would be nice if there was some sort of very high skill weapon that has the potential to kill opponents who are well equipped if you play your cards right and the pipe is not adequate for killing five men unless they ar absolute garbage but at that point you could probably kill them with a sword. My proposal is that you add a musket that take a long time to reload has a slow moving projectile with a lot of bullet drop and damage drop off is expensive to shoot as well but can one shot head shot anyone within let's say 30 meters. So you would be able to kill five armored men but you would have to use very good positioning maybe set up some traps and have cover to reload and retreat while also not missing a single shot but it could be done. Also it might be a good idea to lower the price of the bolty because it's really difficult to justify making one of your using a rifle body you would use for an ak and of course the L96 is just better than it so the bolty either needs a damage buff or price cut honestly it's would be a cool high end mid tear if maybe it didn't cost a rifle body but it did cost a bunch of hqm springs and pipes like a more expensive version of the pump. Also something i've always wanted to see in this game is a high end semi auto maybe an fal since that is what i would consider one of the best survival rifles and its would have m249 damage in a semi auto package maybe it would be op idk but i love the fal and i want to see it in game. Anyway i've gone off on a tangent. Something important to take into account is this game has a very toxic player base not all of them are bad but most are but you can usually find a decent crew to run with if you look hard enough. Basically don't take anything to heart in this game people will be cruel and they dont give a about you if you react more they will probably stick around and try to torture you so sometimes it's best to just let it go and stay quite. Me personally i like to hold grudges at least for that wipe sometimes i'll make a list and if your on it i will kos and you will be a prime target for raids and i might partake in casualy hunting you like an animal for fun(please don't take that out of context because it looks really bad but it's just a game). Basically this is a hardcore survival experience that is best played with friends solo is brutal and not for those who can't handle abuse. It's a game where the highs are super high and the lows will have you contemplating why you ever bothered picking this game up. One thing worth noting is that these devs are some of the best i've ever seen i love how devoted they are to this game and it's insane that they have kept up with this weekly updates for all these years seriously facepunch thank you for your hard work you have made an amazing and it's sure to get better. You have given me some really awesome experiences with this game and even though im taking a break from it for now it's one that i will never forget. To anyone considering this game i would say it's worth a buy on sale mainly since your either going to love it or hate but it's worth the experience try and see if you can survive a wipe i'd love to hear how it went.,Rust

428879,2018-02-08,0,0,1744,False,Recommended,Rust was the highlight of my year for 2016 2017 and the beginning of 2018. I have spent 1.7k hours on this game coming home after school at 4 00 in the afternoon and binge playing Rust well into early the next morning with all my friends. Though I never was and still am not extremely skilled at the game the game offers a variety of options to make your experience great. Primarily Rust is a sandbox where you can do pretty much anything the majority of it offers combat/pvp which when playing with friends involves high levels of communication &amp strategy while other parts of it offer building crafting farming etc. The game is 100% a lot better when you have a group of friends to play it with as it will make the experience a lot more fun. I would highly recommend this game to any of my friends.A couple negative points about the game though which I do want to throw in for anybody that may be considering to purchase the game. Toxic Playerbase the community/playerbase of Rust is extremely toxic and not friendly or helpful to newcomers. If you look at a community like Greekgodx Ice Poseidon or Sodapoppin it is a mixture of all three communities combined I know that isn't good The majority of toxicity is caused by salty 12 year olds who aren't able to handle the aspects of this rage inducing game. Cheaters the community does have a notable amount of cheaters though I haven't played in a good 4 months the game had a lot of cheaters back in early/mid 2017 which did cause a lot of issues and made the game not enjoyable to play anymore. This game is very rage inducing so to work hard to put up a base farm materials and craft gear and to have it taken by a cheater doesn't sink in that well.,Rust

428922,2015-08-31,0,0,177,True,Recommended,Honestly this game is great. shooting building and a heirarchy of power.The only thing that i am getting angry about is the stupid things the developers keep doing. I find it annoying that when the devs leave something out e.g. you can use ladders to scale to loot rooms and weaker points (great raiding tactics) the deleted that. I hate them for that after all the intellegent raider's hard work all they can do is make raiding boring slow and dumb. they also removed normal stairs many people used this to hide their loot from raiders. I mean COME ON i work hard with other raiders and builders to create this handy tactic and they delete it?!?I must say that from my point of view (i am a raider) this is a crime. People work hard on learning new interesting ways to raid bases and 'whoops!' sorry its gone. I also think that the developers should spend more time trying to fix the fact that deers and boars can walk through rocks and walls. But instead the focus their interests on making the game boring. Can you see where this is going? they are making the game soooo boooring...Another nasty thing about this game is the fact that the combat system is THE WORST. it is completely useless. recoil on guns make it better to use that useless bolt action rifle the stupid bow or just waste ammo with a rocket launcher. I think this is why raiders dont do frontal assaults as they just get mowed down in thin corridors. What i am trying to tell you (or the devs) is that this comabt system is HORRIBLE because of the extreme recoil on every singe gun. so much recoil that when i got my hands on a newly added machine gun 5 bullets got me to face the ceiling. wow. that didnt end well i might have had to retreat and lick my wounds for tomorrow.But other than that it is pretty good. Stashes was a good way to hide loot put a secret loot room under your foundation and place secret stashes next to the containers? nice. And the game isnt going to be boring for a long time that time being when you are just hitting rocks and slapping wood because the game has made raiding impossible. and i think that that is why this game is so populare raiding. so many good times... so funny... If they keep on ruining raiding however i am going to ask for a refund.Also (just saying) this game is full of Russians. and although theey are nice when they ARENT raiding you there is that 1 in 1000 that decides to shoot you when you are trying to be kind. But who can blame him? he cant speak english so there is no way he can understand us. 6/10. stop ruining raiding.,Rust

428991,2018-09-04,0,0,1292,False,Recommended,Rust is kind of glitchy and has high pc requirements to run imo. Be careful about the people you trust because they can easily betray you or inside your clan and steal everything. Don't let random people join you... don't expect people to help either.The developers continue to add new content which was recently the cargo ship and hot air ballon. The cargo is buggy. The air balloon has some glitches. Other than that the point is that they add new things every 2 weeks or so with the updates. My advice is to find a server that you enjoy the most. Modded servers are easier to navigate as a new player because they give more loot faster and you can learn faster by progressing faster throughout the wipe.Don't forget to honey comb with triangles. Lock your boxes. Lock your doors. Spread your loot out. Build stable/sturdy houses. Enjoy the game. Don't get tilted and if you do take a break. ) The community is toxic on some servers and better on others. Every wipe is different. Find friends to play with. Of all the hours I've spent playing Rust I have only encountered one clan that has super obvious hackers (ESP). Other than that this game is amazing and the developers do a good job of adding new content. &lt 3 Highly recommend.,Rust

You can make a garden build a quarry destroying a neighbor's house if you want crafting weapons bombs and even destroy a helicopter. The graphics are wonderful you get into the role of bald and start running like you're a headless chicken. The adrenaline that you feel while you steal a house and feel much attention is called unique. The game is in early access and that's good because every month add new things that help the game content and make it more entertaining. I played quite this game and I can say that in the future will be a work of art and if you play it you'll regret it.For me it is a 10/10By the way skin color your pen*s size and size of your bo*bs in case of female depend on your steam id so good luck with that ROFL..,Rust

Majority of the buildings you need to get food and scrap etc are populated with at least one or two camping there waitng to gank you while you loot.

429076,2018-06-15,0,0,1673,False,Recommended,If you want a post apoc survival game with resource gathering building pvp than this is the best value for money game you can buy. Most people who play it have thousands of hours because of the amount of fun you can have from playing this game. Rust just like its theme is unforgiving. you risk everything just to try to survive and thrive. There is a very steep learning curve but the more you watch videos of the game and practicing different servers you will become better at the game with experience. Make friends or play with friends. You will have a much better chance of surviving and winning fights/raids against other groups. place lots of sleeping bags around it makes it easier to get back to your body WHEN you die. because you WILL die..... Alot. Cheers. p.s. dont trust anyone and remember to always shut your doors.,Rust

429082,2018-11-16,0,0,212,False,Recommended,Probably one of the most frustrating games you'll ever play especially as a solo player but there is just something about this game that draws you to come back even though you've been beaten down time after time you can't help but love this game and once you really start to get the hang of the game like me you will probably sink hundreds of hours into the game within a week or two.To start things off with the most satisfying and rewarding part of the entire game The exhilerating combat situations you end up in this game are what makes it so fun and is what makes it so replayable. Getting a sweet sweet bow headshot is beyond satisfying especially once you've mastered it you feel like an absolute god. Also using spear and other weapon combos are also needed to be used very strategically to pay off as the enemy could easily just pick up your weapon and leave you defenceless which is yet another combat mechanism to master in order for you to have the quickest most fun start. Not to say that you need to be a PVP god to enjoy the game it's still very enjoyable taking your time with gathering your loot then going out to battle this is especially recommended to newer players if you aren't comfortable or used to the combat yet. But a word of warning if you are going into your first server as a solo and don't want to be thrown straight into the line of fire I'd recommend joining a solo only server as no group limit servers could have several roofcampers or even zergs.Next off the farming aspect of the game is somewhat boring at the start mainly because of how slow the rock farms and that nodes don't always spawn near you so you may have a hard time getting arrows or stronger tools. But other than that farming is very simple and no bs. If you manage to come across an edible plant or hemp you can plant them outside your base for easy food (be warned that people can steal or even break your crops). There isn't really anything else to be said about farming other than to watch your back because some people like to roam around and kill farmers for easy loot!Another aspect you'll want to know about is how to get loot like the ak47's that everyone desires or the m249! Generally you'll be finding all of the top range loot in big monuments that require puzzles to be solved in order to find the loot or even fighting off scientists with guns. You'll need keycards to do these puzzles which are found in lesser monuments but they shouldn't be too hard to find. There are several types of crates in rust which all contain different rarities of items. There are Basic crates Tool Boxes Food Crates Military Crates and elite loot crates which have the best loot but require alot of grinding to get to but hey RNG can sometimes send you straight to top dog in a matter of minutes! If you are a new player you could just set your self up to a small monument like gas station or mining outpost which shouldn't be too crowded but can still supply you with basic loot like revolvers or shotguns. Most experienced players will prefer to setup up next to the most populated monuments to find alot of pvp or loot nearby and will also try to set up next to a small recycling monument to easily get scrap from spare components.Finally building and Crafting. In rust you can create a building plan and a hammer which will let you make your very own base building a simple base is self explanatory however to protect your base from raiders and campers you may want to add some more complex features to your base e.g an airlock (2 or more doors facing each other so you can trap or stop players from entering your base) honeycombing(triangular reinforcements around your base so enemies raiding you will have to blow through several walls rather than just one. Also with the hammer you can upgrade your base using different materials each making your base significantly stronger. There is twig wood stone sheet metal and armoured. A good rule to go by is to never leave your base at twig level (remember you foundation!) because at twig level anyone can come along with any item (even a rock) and just knock it down. Also while we are on the topic of building I'll mention the Tool Cupboard sometimes referred to as TC the tool cupboard will claim a small area around it than only you can build on so you can't be griefed or so other people can't build on your stuff! However unless the TC is locked or hid behind walls and a door than anyone can authorise themselves to it and build all over your property also if they have authorisation of your TC they can unauthorise anyone on it so you'll no longer be able to build there. So now crafting crafting in itself is pretty simple and won't take long to get the hold of however there may be a few things your are not going to understand like Blueprints and workbenches. So some items in Rust aren't immediatley craftable so in order to craft them you'll first need to find one of the item learn it on a research table using scrap and then most likely have to use a workbench to craft that item and the higher tier the item is the higher tier workbench you will need.Thank you for reading my review obviously there is a lot more to rust than what I have stated and it is an absolute blast to play and I can honestly recommend it to anyone it is one of the most addicting thrilling games I have ever played. Good Luck in Rust &lt 3,Rust

429134,2018-11-22,0,0,279,False,Recommended,Played since the very first game released and onto this version. I'll always remember the horrid screams of terror from people getting hacked to pieces by scavengers the ominous threats of slaughter between factions times long before the appearance of road sign armour where having full radiation gear meant you were a demigod but could easily be dethroned by the knock of a single arrow from a man you never saw coming.No matter the playstyle the behaviour the morals and lack thereof you practice in Rust you'll always find two things 1 There will always be noobies who have died a hundred times before learning any basic skills2 There will always be the one guy you wish you never metNo matter what happens treat your fellow players like your kin and you'll always have fun. (Smashing the corpses of your enemies is fun too)Every update brings something new even if it is a small bit of glitch fixing or big releases like new items or even map updates RUST always makes me giddy whenever I see the download pending and even more when I launch the game (And it crashes and takes 20 years to load in to a server)Love it forever,Rust

I have almost 4000 hours in it and can't seem to take a break away from it. Love it! The spawn kills are still savage but once you get a hang of it you survive those kills. You can't really just build a base and think you won't be raided. You have to plan it just right and defend it too during raids thus keeping you active in the game. Not gonna lie I get tilted at the game too but it's just another love hate relationship. I would totally recommend this game to a friend.,Rust

429144,2017-02-25,0,0,220,False,Not Recommended,I have almost 200 hours in this game. I don't recommend it.They fixed all the funny bugs like bears walking through the ground they continue to make changes some of which are useful and cool (ie adding content like new guns and armor and plants and monuments) but most changes make pointless changes to mechanics fixing problems no one had or making the game unbalanced till those changes were reverted a couple of updates later. The community is a toxic cesspool anyone thats friendly is probably terrible and going to be dead weight everyone else is a and wants your blood the moment you respawn. Its a horrible unless you know at least 5 people to play with at least two of which much be online 100% of the time. It lags like a on community servers and the official servers are the worst for cancerous players and being harassed by large groups of people. The randomly generated maps are very samey and uniform. They're always familiar. The map generator probably took two weeks to write using some Perlin noise and a random walk that makes rivers and it showsIf you manage to make a base somewhere away from other players you're still forced to move around and forage and most likely come into contact with other players due to the fact that animals are extremely sparse so you'll have to make a trip to one of the premade monuments whenever they respawn food and items. Likely to find that it was cleared out by a clan 5 minutes ago and they're still hanging around or that its being scouted out by someone who has been playing since day one of the server wipe and has all the best gear already. Add on top of this the poor optimisation that comes from being a Unity game that is completely remade every 3 months.Actual game would be pretty ok if the community wasn't absolute trash and if the devs made actual improvements for each new version instead of wanking in a corner and calling the pathetic dribbles on the wall a game.,Rust

You can meet salty 45 year olds or toxic 10 year olds or.... cheaters. That is the worst part of this game. If you can find a good server with good admins that is the cream of the crop.

There are plenty of server options to choose from if the big vanilla servers overwhelm you at first which should help you get your feet in the game.

429196,2016-09-17,0,0,400,False,Not Recommended,I want to love this game but I just can't. This game was really fun in the past but now it just is grinding 24/7. The new upkeep system came out and just ruined it now this game is just a farm simulator. The only way to make it in Rust now is you have to have no life be part of a clan or zerg and play on the same server ever wipe and be the first to join after the wipe. I really wish I could get back into this game but with all these reasons it just is not fun you rarley fight because one bullet and you loose 12+ hours of progress. So I rate this game a 9/10 before the cupboards and now I rate this game 3.5/10 not fun not worth the money and not worth wasting your life.,Rust

429215,2018-11-24,0,0,2315,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I now have over 2 000 hours in Rust I have been playing this game for over 3 years I have enjoyied the game for a long time and it still keeps me entertained. The game does have a big learning curve in which i think the devs are working on a turtorial to help with that but its best to play with a friend for at least when your starting out to help teach you how things work or watch a lot of youtube videos. Even when you know how to play well the game will be better with friends or a clan because more people can get more things done and its a overall better experience. The game is really diverse and thats what keeps me playing every time I log on I know unique things and encounters with other players will happen that i've never seen before so it keeps the game fresh. Also every time a server wipes there is never a repeated map so it is always changing and keeping the content new and interesting. This game can support multiple play styles but it can be fustrating and rage endusing when your learning the game as mostly everyone will kill you. P.S. Don't trust anyone in game.,Rust

429217,2016-08-02,0,0,2234,False,Recommended,Honestly one of the best if not THE BEST survival game out there.With over 2000 hours invested into the game I can say that this game is definitely the game you'd want to play if you're looking for some hardcore yet noob friendly when it comes to learning survival experience to enjoy to the fullest with your friends! Start off with a rock make your way up through simple weapons and tools by harvesting and woodcutting/mining resources all the way to the most advanced of tools/structures and weapons for you to craft and build.A serious time killer you can never go wrong purchasing this game! All that and a whole lot more for only $20!Edit Price changed to $34.99 since I wrote this review due to the fact that it came out of Early Access still makes for an amazing game definitely worth the price.

The community has gotten way too toxic. Killing fresh spawns is now a sport for the unskilled PvP players. The dev team tried to help nakeds by putting a sash on the ones that have gear on them so you can identify someone who has gear and is naked but it hasnt helped any. Joined a server today in hopes to enjoy some rust like I once had. As soon as I was spawned in I was instantly met with a swift death by some kid screaming racist remarks ""I am killing all those that dont look like me."" I miss the days of meeting someone random teaming up and raiding a base that the players are online to defend themselves. Now its players in global chat asking for help to raid a base that has ""tons of loot"" while not one player is online to defend it. If you're a new player to rust and just recently purchased the game I feel sorry for you because you wont get a great experience because of the egdelords and reddit kids who now plague every server.

429262,2019-01-15,0,0,41,False,Recommended,"This is my review so far having played 22.4 hours as a noob.I like this game alot. I think it has alot of potential. I read somewhere that it is still a game in development so I hope this review is at least read even if discarded.I think Rust is one of the most intriguing survial games I have come across so far. On the main servers there really is no forgiveness and at first this seemed insanely harsh especially due to the griefers.I met some people instantly even when I was completely naked and almost had nothing just take me out for ""fun's sake?""Okay I kind of get it. This is a brutal world even though I don't know if there is any story here. Nature mixed with the modern and everyone is hunting each other. Really feels like there should be a main lore here.Anyway I spent about three or four days getting enough materials to start a new base. On the second night I had been successfully farming hemp and collecting in the wild to make a full cloth armor set as well as a decent spear.That same night I saw some guy collecting stuff near my tree and I killed him. I got a number of supplies and added it to my small boxes.I had enough materials to provide protection of my base for a number of days so I really started feeling I would develop my small home to at least stone and possibly a metal door before I had any trouble.Boy I was wrong. Final night I was alive. I heard someone approach. I took out the metal blade I had made from some previous looted metal fragments and wood I had gathered and made what I thought was at least a starter decent metal blade.I had some cloth armor on at this point but not fully clothed because I had been killed by a pig after two or three strikes even after I thought I hit it twice with a wooden bow. I died the previous day to that pig so I lost my full set.This last night I readied my blade and had my door closed though I knew it was weak.In a few moments this guy blew up one of my stone walls or still remaining wooden ones with guns or explosives not sure.However then as I stayed quiet getting ready for him to approach he fires some shots sounding like they were from an AK and boom just like that I died. I didn't even hit him once.My bag was so close though I instantly respawned. This time again naked and just having a rock. I hit him once with the rock I think and ""boom"" I was hit again from some fire from his gun.To be fair I had killed a guy the previous night naked with very little and now this guy had hunted me.Fair and Square and he is going to get all of my loot.However I had just felt like I was begining to develop and since stone doesn't seem as common as wood it's not even that super fast to be able to upgrade to stone walls at least and or a foundation within the first few days and just like that all of your hard work can be gone and you start out again with almost nothing.I get this is part of the game and I don't see this changing where just like that ""boom your gone""However I do feel that the developers want to attract more people and I feel there are alot of players that would seriously hate having to grind even this basic stuff out and just in a heartbeat lose everything after taking so much time and resources to develop even minimal protection and progress.I am not going to advocate that pvp servers should be gone. That would ruin the point of the game as a survival one.I do question though if at least some specific servers should be dedicated pve ones or at least safe within certain specific territories.With the world that exists so far I don't think that would be a huge stretch.Not everyone wants to be forced to join a clan or group up to survive.It should be possible at least on some servers that certain zones allow the player to reach at least a certain level of development on their own before being killed orat least allow the player to live within certain small areas of the game where they can not be harrassed at all if they don't want to be bothered.This worked with wow and I don't think it's that bad of an idea.Then if that player chooses to go out into the wider world that isn't protected they are agreeing on taking their chances possibly for higher rewards to entice.I would like to see this game grow but right now considering gamers in a general basis and not just hardcore Rust Fans I feel if the dev's would like this game to grow more it should at least have a bit more dedicated servers to being pve or noob friendly.",Rust

I really like that skill is the way you win and not your level. With the way you level up being by learning to make/build new things. Territory is extremely important. If you keep getting killed that means you most likely are in another player/s area and can either fight or flee. For a computer game in 2019 it's done really really well ) Thanks Rust!,Rust

429327,2018-11-24,0,0,87,False,Recommended,Rust certainly has its pros and cons. It's definatly not worth the current price point I bought it during early access for pretty cheap. It's not at all suited for single player. For sure it needs to be played on multi person servers or with friends on a private server. It's pretty simple in regards to gameplay. The challenges come from the threat of other people and thats pretty much it. At least in games like ARK and 7 Days there's those other danger elements that make it more playable alone. The modded servers can be pretty fun. The official servers are completely toxic and are unfortunately the only way to get achievements. If you have other friends who play then its worth getting on sale. If its just you and you're not comfortable playing on multi person servers alone then I suggest looking for something else.,Rust

You can't launch the game play for 10 minutes and quit long play sessions are about the only real way to make progress.Once you get the hang of the gameplay and get yourself a cabinet established the game will change a bit. Oh you still die a lot but you'll get the hang of venturing out scavenging/mining resources and returning to base to stash your loot. When you choose a server look for one with a very recent reset or everyone you meet will have machine guns. I found one with a reset two weeks prior and even that was a little brutal but I'm working my way up.The only downside is the long loadtime especially the first time you play a server.

My second experience i decided to go on a smaller server as to decrease the likelyhood of me being griefed as well as hopefully find a community of newer players to trade with and overall have an enjoyable experience play for 4 days over break making a large house and trade with a few players log on fifth day died by (Chinese characters) while offline spawn nearby and head back to base completely intact no doors broken hmmm go inside go through 6 airlocks closing doors behind me and find my inner lootroom stairs destroyed as well as TC everything else fine including walls get shot in back by (same Chinese characters) return again only to see them seal the base off just so i cant use it they leave I give up on game.Overall the game can be fun but playing something for a few days straight only to have some cheater log on and ruin it all as well as monthly wipes is not my idea of fun i would not recommend the experience to anyone. They need to change some things to make the players work together or focus on another foe altogether or have some in game punishment for griefing or destroying people unprovoked such as a heli and group of scientists. until then this game is a pointless grind.",Rust
429394,2018-11-24,0,0,17,False,Not Recommended,First impressions are it would be an amazing game but as usual the kiddies who really should not really be playing this sort of game just have to go and ruin it for everybody with their toxic attitudes. It's a shame there are not any servers that implement an age verification system as i imagine playing this on a server with mature people would be an amazing experience.I also wonder if it was created as some kind of social experiment. It has the potential to change you into some kind of sociopath. When i started playing my mindset was 'I could never loot items that someone else has worked hard to gather' half hour in am desperately hungry and thirsty find a dead body with some food and water on them i loot it and feel bad about it. Another half hour goes by and i am killing and looting people without a care in the world.Update being new i did not know about 'server wipes' so basically once a month all the materials you gather the base you build the weapons and armor you craft as well as everything else you manage to gather gets wiped so every month you have to start all over again. Sorry but that makes this the most pointless waste of time/effort game ever.,Rust

""Oh you don't get to choose in real life so you don't get to choose here"" Because in real life I gather wood by hitting a tree wtih a rock after I arrive with nothing but a rock and a torch ........this isn't real life so why deny me a little customisation.Secondly the game makes it needlessly annoying to gather resources. Wood is fine enough stones can only be gathered by finding the small stone clusters on the ground or the minable stones from the very few rocks out of the very many textured rocky areas in the land that you need to get to grips with fast. Most of the time you will be running about trying to find these...then need to worry about your hunger levels which start off drastically low and continue to drop as you run about making a race of who can find the first canned food or chocolate and actually be able to concentrate on normal resources.But it doesn't stop there oh no if you want to build anything and have it last more than a few hours....enjoy stuffing your cupboards full of more resources more running about trying to find stone and other such just to maintain what you have done.Unless you have a lot of friends with you working to help you with this skip it.",Rust

He then forced me into becoming a slave and joining his already growing slave labor force. I had 2 other people helping me get wood for theses people with guns. then after we got them a couple thousand wood. they lined us up and shot us. By this point I was a lightly salted but I respawn. I go towards some trees and start to get wood I craft a few basic tools from the wood and rocks near by. then i start to get hit i turn around and there is a bear. ""I can take this bear down"" I think so I attack it with my spear. It kills me in 2 seconds. By this point I've moved past lightly salted and more into the salt induced coma. i ask in the chat after i respawn ""does anyone want to team up?"" I rappidly get a responce telling me to kill myself and respawn at the sleeping bag they've made for me. i knew it was a troll but i had nothing to lose so i killed myself. I then respawned in a walled in space with a door and no roof with 5 other people. all we had was the starting rock. then we hear ""who ever survives gets to join us kill each other"" then out of no where they all started to beat each other with rocks. i died again and waited the the required time before respawning in the sleeping bag. I respawn in and its night and they are all gone and sleeping. so i walk over to get my revenge and kill 2 of them in their sleep before being killed. then they destroyed my sleeping bag so i couldn't do it again. after that I still havent returned to this excuse of a game.0/10 would play ""Click the respawn button every 30seconds"" game again",Rust

429444,2018-07-16,0,0,1829,False,Recommended,"Great game fun concept and difficulty is just right it's not too easy when you begin making you work to learn and understand the game further progression allows you to understand more of the mechanics of the game and learn how to speed up the process of starting.Basics for starting off Get off the beach preferably into a thicker forest a place that offers protection and gets you out of the main eye sight of looted players begin by collecting Hemp and Wood and the ocassional stone by this time you need to begin thinking about water and food I'd say hunting is your best bet however the more you feel comfortable then I'd say go ahead and walk into a gas station or supermarket. (Fair warning this one is risky) From this look on the map and try to find the best place with easy water access don't worry about food as you can always plant food or hunt either work and if worse comes to worse and you live near enough to clean drinking water just eat other humans...Simply put the game is hard however slowly becomes easier as you get better towards the game and allows you to open up a great game with friends. BUGS There are a few simple bugs that occur killing an animal on a foundation usually glitches the animal through the floor making it impossible to loot or harvest.If you purchase any skins either from the direct store or from the Market you might get the ""no icon"" bug where it either has no icon in your inventory or has a massive bugges icon.The game also needs some optimization increases personally I don't get many FPS realted issues I can pull just about 60fps at a stable rate but I hear and see a lot of people with the issues.Other then that the game is cleanly made and as already stated brilliant!I love the many differences between textures the attention to detail and the fact no map is the same it gives the game a load of replayability.NOTE Don't play on Community Servers unless incredibly popular most community servers wipe every 4 days due to the fact thier population drops so fast so to get it back up they wipe I'd say go for either an incredibly popular community server or join an offical.Good luck!Still going strong!",Rust

This is a type of game where its kill or be killed if your nice you better watch your back because over 89% of players here haven't been around since the good days of where you could walk up to sombody and say hello now adays nobody would really talk to you. This is a game when you can get drain out the first few 100rds of hours and still not even have a base down once and you might think it is a game because it is but the amount of fun it was with friends was great i am giving this a bad review because this game is made for groups and non aint social people aren't gonna make it here and its funny because you can't even go around talking to people without getting killed.

429558,2018-11-24,0,0,734,False,Recommended,For people who want a quick anwser well there is no really quick anwser because everyone is different but go try it out it's performace is great and graphics are beautiful but be aware that a lot of people are really unfriendly...(Sadly it has become like this before it was a very friendly community now it's hard to find people who are just nice)And now i have played this game for a very long time i even played it cracked but i always knew that i will buy this game even if it is to support it and so i did.But the problem i have with this game is that a lot of people are very unfriendly they don't even let you build anything camp even sometimes trashtalk you...I would highly suggest to ignore those people and if you can have friends playing with you so you will have a higher chance of survival.And then there is the modded servers which are fine but it killed my motivation to play proper vanilla so if you can stay away from it unless you are just fine with playing both.And again i'm not saying that modded servers are bad it's that you get everything really fast and you just don't have any other reason to play really just pvp.And talking about PVP youtubers of rust kinda ruined it with their 'Raid Cams' everyone wanted to be like those clans and missed a very important thing it's a game and people want to have fun and not be sniped from a tower or camped at a spawn.So if you can deal with these problems you are good to go but before that i just want to say that developers are doing a great job of keeping this game alive and fresh i just hope people start changing for the better!Good luck and remmember to have fun!,Rust

The game takes a ton of hours just to get to a point where you feel you have some sort of level playing field with large clans that basicly have 6 10 people. The blueprint grind on this game is hectic. Especially if you play solo on a heavy populated server. (Low pop servers tend to die out quick and get really boring) Watch youtube movies on how to build a proper base otherwise you get raided instantly and you're immediately discouraged from playing the game again. Best server configuration in my opinion is 2 week wipe. (and 2x resource gathering if available ) The grouping system that's been recently introduced has made the solo gameplay really difficult. So I suggest making friends in game and use the system to your advantage.Besides that the game is really fun. During your wipe you'll experience up's and down's. Killing a semi geared guy with a bow and grabing his loot will give you such a rush but minutes later you'll find yourself raided and lose all of it.Nature of the game so don't get attached to anything you make or loot.,Rust

429645,2017-12-29,0,0,2293,False,Recommended,Just over 2k hours. There is strength in numbers this is a game that heavily favours larger groups. Generally the larger your group the further you'll progress. It's extremely unforgivng you can lose 100+ hours of progress in a matter of minutes. This game is best with friends but VERY challenging as a solo. Great game overall best devs of any game I've played.,Rust
429646,2018-12-19,0,0,63,False,Not Recommended,The game could be fun. But the community just sucks. Mostly stupid people who either kill you instantly after respawn or chatter the out of you with stupid talk.I know that this is not a problem of the game itself but it essentially makes the game unplayable unless you become one of those people by yourself. Which is not an option for me.,Rust
429647,2018-12-19,0,0,155,False,Not Recommended,"This is a game that in regular gameplay requires dedication at the cost of corruption.You build a base and spend hours building it up and someone can undo your progress swiftly with a raid. In fact most raids are offline because you weren't on. You have to invest more time to prevent a raid by gathering materials and resources at the cost of losing more progress because of it. The problem is there's no such thing as an ""unraidable base"" because of two things. C4 and ladders. C4 is expensive but it can make short work of external walls and ceilings. Next are ladders. You can place ladders and twig on buildings without build permission so nothing stops you from filling gaps with twig or entering your base at practically any floor because of ladders. Because you can basically always get raided and because a lot is at stake people tend to take it personally. I'm not sure if it just attracts toxicity but people tend to get absolutely I'm fine if people say things in a jokingly hostile manner like opening fire on a building saying ""FBI OPEN UP"" but the people wandering around who kill at random do it mostly for protection as opposed to ""I have a voice in my head. It says I need to harvest you for your flesh"" that's a chaotic violence that's more fun.In terms of irregular gameplay such as Deathmatch servers and modded the stakes are lowered and your progress is not at as much risk because resources gains are higher or there are restrictions preventing you from losing as much. They reduce the burden of being on as much as possible because radiation and decay are reduced or removed and make it more casual so if you have a life you can spend more time with it than worrying about the responsibilities of having to log in a lot or else risk losing your hard work from building. You can't really put it down unless you're fine with putting it down for a while. Or pick a day on a server that wipes and when it wipes retire for a while. Though wipes itself is flawed because you lose all your progress sometimes not including blueprints but with the addition of multiple new researchable items like electronics which are already expensive it raises the stakes even more and make the cost of actually using them where they're worth it is higher. You need to be dedicated and spend a lot of time while be willing to lose that progress to people who are ether faceless or toxic.",Rust
429648,2018-12-19,0,0,122,False,Recommended,One of the best games however you have to be one hell of a sometimes. Rust is one of those games that you'll never forget i've made countless memories and each one i can recall with ease. The game is so good because of how random one minute you could be holding a bow in some leather ponchos and the next you'll be in a hazmat suit and an AK 47 in your hand. Just give it a go but you will need a good pc to run though. Enjoy ),Rust

429654,2018-12-20,0,0,887,False,Recommended,"Rust is a beautifully made game. The landscapes are detailed the monuments are unique and thought out and all of the building materials items and weapons really fit together in this game well. The sound is awesome hearing the chopper in the distance makes you prepare hearing a sachel raid will bring you in for a closer look and hearing the distinct sound of an AK or M249 will make you want to go jump into the action. No other game has made me use my headset as much every footstep matters. All the amazing content being considered it is the lack of content that really defines this game in my mind. It is a very well done open world concept i especially like the procedural maps each wipe keeping things fresh and exciting. What you do where you build how you interact with people is all up to you and makes for a different experience almost every time you turn it on. There is a lot of reviews and comments about a ""toxic community"" but there are plenty of servers to consider to help filter your experience. You can go to a map with 200 people running around on it and get killed around every corner or go to a map with 20 and have mixed to even more positive interaction with people. All this being said it is a pvp game and one should expect to be shot at or raided it is simply part of what this game is. I've only been playing a couple of months but the extra content that has been added including balloons and electricity in that time has all been very cool and interesting. The APC heli and cargo ship are challenging yet excellent ways to get high level items and even more fun when others arrive to take whats yours! The game has it's bugs snags crashes hackers (which i did not experience) and im sure these things will continue to be fixed and optimized but the overall game as a whole is very good in my opinion.",Rust

429730,2018-11-09,0,0,145,False,Recommended,Rust is a great game that I have thoroughly enjoyed playing over the last three months since i have purchased it however there are some aspects of the game that are very irritating as well as some information on the store page that is quite misleading to say the least.Lets begin with the positives. The game is very fun to play particularly if you have another friend or two to play it with. The community is also not too bad not the worst or best that i have ever seen. However be careful of who you trust in this game cause not everyone is friendly but there is the odd few who you can trust and maybe join forces with. When you get started in this game there really is no limit to what you can do.The negatives that i have is the crappy optimisation of the game more specifically the fact that the game is plagued with a memory leak that eats up all of my 8gb ddr3 RAM making multitasking on my pc an impossibility so checking discord is a no can do unless of course you want to wait forever and risk crashing the game. This RAM issue is very common and leads me onto my second point which is the minimum system specs that facepunch has advertised for rust. More specifically the RAM requirement which states 8GB but not whether you should have DDR3 or 4. I can answer that question very easily it CANNOT RUN on 8GB DDR3 it has been a pain in the for me running this game and apart from chopping wood mining and crafting anything else is verging unplayable especially when there is such a heavy emphasis on combat in this game so you can't really play the game if every time somebody shoots you your game becomes a power point presentation. I can however run on 8GB DDR4 ram according to my friend so if you have that no problem however i would severely recommend upgrading your ram and/ or mobo (if cpu needs replacing).In conclusion i like this game it is really really fun (when it works) however i regret buying it without looking into it more or upgrading my specs beforehand and honestly i would like them to make the game more reliable especially for the money that you have to pay for it now.,Rust

429753,2018-11-24,0,0,58,False,Not Recommended,"Do you have a job college or school to attend? Do you have a life that exists beyond the confines of your bedroom? Do you have an obligation to leave the house at all? Then Rust isn't for you.Doing anything is a long and tedious process building your first base will likely take you a couple of hours. You need to have a good chunk of time to invest in just getting set up in whatever server you choose to join but rest assured that if you have anything at all dragging you away from the PC you'll be back at square one when you return.In order to have a base that you can realistically leave overnight without getting raided it needs to be stone/metal with perimeter walls. This takes HOURS of grinding. Your simple wooden shack might survive without getting blown to kingdom come but only if you're really lucky. If you do manage to survive and over time upgrade your base to something a little more robust than a pile of planks then you'll get to experience the joy of raiding.In between chopping down trees foraging for hemp/mushrooms and mining stone you might have crafted yourself a nice little crude arsenal of spears arrows and hatchets. No doubt you'll be feeling proud about this and certainly more secure knowing that you're armed. You might even feel like you're ready for a little PVP... Spoiler you're not . You will get absolutely f*cking shredded as soon as you come into contact with anyone who isn't a naked. You might think that you can band together with others and face the harshness of the Rust world in solidarity with another mortal but you'll be lucky if you encounter someone who isn't going to kill you steal your loot or flat out ignore you. So then as a new starter ""raiding"" for you will consist solely of wandering the map areas digging through boxes for scrap and cowering in fear whenever you hear another player approach knowing he's going to be fully armoured and sporting an SMG at the very minimum.No matter how much time you've invested in scouring the empty parts of the map for items you'll never be as well equipped as the kids who've been grinding all their waking hours since the last server wipe. Even if the server was only wiped a couple of days ago there'll already be monumental stone and metal bases guarded by turrets. The only way you can get ahead in this game or indeed have any kind of fun playing at an even level is if you and at least two friends can devote HOURS a day every day to grinding and maintaining your base. When I bought this game I was led to believe it was at heart a survival game that rewards co operation and skilful play. The reality is that it's essentially Minecraft with nudity. From the tedious crafting to the aimless gameplay and the autistic shut in playerbase this game apes Mojang's virtual lego in almost every manner except it fails to provide the player with the choice to actually do something else with their time.Frankly the only other thing I can think of that requires this degree of effort and commitment whilst being equally tedious is a full time job. And just in case you have trouble choosing between Rust or a job remember that at least the job pays you.",Rust

429809,2018-08-10,0,0,1584,False,Not Recommended,I would not recommend this game to players who do not have friends that want to play with them and players who do not have over 15 hours a day to put into this game going offline for the smallest amount of time is almost certain for an offline raid at the hands of a bigger group who does not sleep modded is a bit more forgiving but does not yield a true rust experience as vanilla does. building is too complicated for new players so they are easy targets for SOME of the toxic community to screw over and take everything they have built up over the multiple hours they have built up. the game used to be better with offline raids only happening 2 3 days into the wipe which is enough time for anyplayer to get a good experience out of the wipe it's enough time for them to experience everything in the game and have fun whilst doing so. Now you can spend 5 6 hours just focusing on building a base and when you log off you can check for big bases around you might not see any but whilst your asleep another group will have stayed up all night building a bigger base than you and then raid you before you can even wake up the next morning. Rust is not worth the $50 Aus to not be able to properly play vanilla if you do not have 15+ hours on your hands each day and a group to work with the only servers that will yield fun and satisfaction will be those that are modded modded is not worth $50,Rust

429900,2018-10-25,0,0,1041,False,Recommended,Well here we go i started playing Rust when it was still in early access that said it's fair to say i saw a lot of changes through my time playing this game. What is Rust? Rust is a survival game that let's you farm hunt animals build a base and interact with other players that are doing the same thing. I would like to explain how a wipe is played in rust in 3 sectionsWipe A period of time which you play before the server restarts and everyone starts fresh without any bases etc...Early game You first spawn on the beach and with a rock you work your way up to your first base that's usually takes an hour or so depends on what server you play and how lucky are you on the position you spawn. In the early game you will use a bow or a crossbow to protect yourself from other players or animals when you will fell confident enough you will start going to rad towns to loot from boxes and pvp. But the most important thing will always be resources.Mid game You start to get better weapons and you have a good amount of resources to work with your main objective is to get c4 and AK crafted as soon as possible to give you the edge in the pvp's. You will also start hearing explosions of satchels that are going off it gives you the chills if you are going to be the next target.Late game You have all the gear you want you also have the best weapons out there just pvp every time you see someone you feel confident enough to take him out you start raiding the big bases with rockets and c4 if the defenders are online the experience is soooo much better.The game is fun if you play with a group of 3 or 4 you will have tons of fun.PROS The graphics are good maybe not optimized for every graphics card there is but still very enjoyable graphics.Fun to play with friends but you can always play solo if that's your thing.You have so many weapons to choose from so you can pick your style of pvp.The system of crafting and farming is easy to learn and if you don't have the components for the item you want to craft there is always trading with other people that's why there is a server chat.You can make so many different bases layouts it's kinda insane )The devs are very interactive with the community and are also featuring the content creators that are making Rust videos.There are skins for the weapons and also updates every 2 weeks.THE GAME WILL NEVER BE P2W the game is about skill.CONS The community is really toxic.If you don't have a decent internet connection you will not be able to play on the official servers if the closest is still far away from you.ZERGS i have so many complaints about this but i will keep it simple. Zergs are usually 10 or more man groups that usually get the best weapons first and just on the smaller groups that are just starting to get to mid game and you can't really win with 4 friends versus 15 man groups in a small area and if they decide to raid you your base is gone the biggest problem of Rust is toxic zergs and zergs in generally if you ask anyone about zergs everyone will tell you the same thing over and over again. Also i heard of 30 man zergs but never actually seen one on the servers i was playing.I don't play Rust anymore because i lost the hype for playing it and the new updates are not for me liked the old Rust better but that's my opinion. But i will recommend the game to people who like this type of games. There is a ton of gameplay to learn from and also to see how the game actually looks like. The game is a solid 8/10 for me.Gl and HF in the next wipe guys ),Rust

429941,2017-06-14,0,0,1013,False,Recommended,I Billy Herrington stand here today humbled by the task before us mindful of the sacrifices borne by our Nico Nico ancestors.We are in the midst of a crisis. Nico Nico Douga is at war against a far reaching storm of disturbance and deletion. Nico Nico's economy is badly weakened a consequence of carelessness and irresponsibility on the part of acknowledgement but also on the collective failure to make hard choices and to prepare for a new MAD age.Today I say to you that the challenges are real and they are many. They will not be easily met or in a short span of time but know this Nico Nico they will be met. In reaffirming the greatness of our site we understand that greatness is never given our journey has never been one of shortcuts. It has not been for the faint hearted or who seek the fleshly pleasures. Rather it has been the risk takers the wasted genii the creators of MAD things. For us they toiled in sweatshops endured the lash of the spanking. Time and again these men struggled and sacrificed so that we might ... LIVE BETTER.We remain the most powerful site on the Internet our minds no less inventive and services no less needed than they were last week or yesterday or the day before the day after tomorrow. Starting today we must pull up our pants dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking Nico Nico Douga.Now there are some who question the scale of our ambitions who suggest our server system cannot tolerate too many movies. Their memories are short for they have forgotten what Nico Nico already has done what free men can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose.And so to all the people who are watching this video from the grandest cities to the small villages where IKZO was born know that Nico Nico is a friend to every man who seeks the future of love and peace. Now we will begin to responsibly leave authorized common materials to Nico Nico people and forge a hard earned peace in this MAD world.What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility. This is the price and the promise of Nico NiCommons citizenship. Nico Nico Douga in the face of common dangers in this winter of our hardship let us remember these timeless words WE CAN.Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested by DOS attacks when we were refused by YouTube that we did not turn back nor did we falter and we carried forth that great gift of freedom be delivered and safely to future generations.Thank you.

I dont know how i didnt quit playing when i was new to the game i basically only played solo and would constantly get stomped on but as i got better and better i found it harder and harder to stop playing! this game is great and i would 100% recommend it to anyone especially if they have someone else to play it with. the best thing about this game is the endless possibilitys and how different it is every time i play! if i were to play fortnite 100 times it would be basically the same every time i played but if i play rust for 100 wipes every wipe is different one wipe i might make a shop and a hotel and then the next i might research AK and dominate military tunnels ect. what im trying to say is this game (even though it might make you want to quit at first) is the greatest game ive ever played. &lt 3,Rust

Set aside the toxic community and the raging kids and it's a really good game I'd recommend starting out and checking out either battle ground rust servers or building servers to get the hang of the game I'd also try to make some friends either in game or get some real friends to get it. The game experience is very enjoyable and the concept is simple but friend's make it 10x better.

But with all great things there is downsides firstly The community It may be one of the most toxic peice of communties i have ever come across. Secondly It's extremely hard to play solo you'll often find yourself being teamed up on and being killed by groups of three plus you'll constantly be raided but if you persist it'll be rewarding.,Rust

429958,2015-07-04,0,0,352,False,Not Recommended,I reviewed this game in 2015. I played it maybe 20 hours and I gave it a negative review because logging on every day getting raided while at work wasn't fun. Gave it a go in the following years and more seriously here lately. To be honest I only have 350 hours in the game and learned a great deal. But messuring my disapointment vs fun disapointment always seem to win out. Working all weekened to make supplies to raid and getting head shot before you get to use them. Logging in and finding your base has been raided and taken over. Honestly I can get over it and move forward. All apart of learning. But what I can't get past is the scrap grind only to be met with a reset later. All my time is focused on grinding luckyt to get a decent gun which is short lived on how long you can have it before your killed so you never get the exprience to use it correctly. Mean while I could play any FPS game and just be given what is needed to have fun. If I wanted to play a build game I could play something like minecraft and login to all my stuff the very next day. So I find myself asking why don't I just do that? That's exactly what I do each year I try it. See you late 2019 and well see where it's at.,Rust

429991,2017-06-23,0,0,596,False,Not Recommended,After starting rust shortly after the component system was introduced this was one of the best games i'd ever played. It was fun and I didn't have to spend all week playing to have fun. After the blueprint system was introduced it is nearly impossible to join a server and stand a fair chance. You will be fighting guys with AKs with your crossbow. Nearly all weapons are locked behind RNG of trying to find the right item to research or blueprint. The scrap system is incredible unbalanced requiring an unimaginable amount of time required to gather enough to even make a high enough tier workbench to even craft weapons. With no balance against clans on offical servers you will spend a lot of your time dying to not more skilled players but trihard teenagers with better gear and more teammates than you. The game requires all of your time to keep any decent sized base up for any long period of time and weapons are not satisfying to use with the exception of the bow and crossbow and a few of the higher tier weapons. This game is not fun solo and you better pray your group is skilled enough to survive. I cannot recommend this game with its current blueprint system.,Rust

430051,2019-01-03,0,0,91,False,Recommended,It is possibly the best game i ever bought. First the graphics are stunning. Then the gameplay yeah the community is bad but under it is the concept of raiding and blueprints which add a whole new concept to the game.,Rust
430052,2019-01-03,0,0,36,False,Recommended,This game is fun but you do need at least one other person that you know personally or that you met in game that you trust. The lonewolf mthod of getting to the top is extremely hard for newcomers raiders and jsut overall game experience cause you need to grind. Having two or more people makes the game more fun in general and can make grinding more interesting. For example if you are getting resources and talking to your friend you could be discussing the game base layouts raid plans etc. But by yourself you are thinking to yourself and feel lonely sometimes. I regret not haveing anyone else that I know play on a computer. Most kids in my school are playing Fortnut on the Xbox and PS4 (looking for a friend). The community can be toxic with people cheating and backstabbing but if you are lucky the game experience will be good. Summary9/10 recommend it bring friend(s) leanr mechanics in low pop server and don't switch servers because the blueprints that you have in one doesn't transfer to the other. I learned this the hard way by only going into one server and got raided. Lost my entire base. Raged and promised myself not to ever go into that server. Went into a different server and needed to start from scratch. It really frustrating when you are near endgame with electricity and stuff.,Rust

430061,2018-11-27,0,0,598,False,Recommended,Rust is a hardcore survival game that heavily focuses on pvp elements with pve as flavor. Yes people get clans together to dominate servers but that happens on every game with servers that's within or even remotely similar to the genre. The gunplay is good each map is beautiful and unique and the experiences cam be priceless. Is it worth $34.99? Yeah but I'd grab it on sale or on because why wouldn't you? The best part of this game though is the developers. They released a game on early access and they delivered whole heartedly. FacePunch Studios contiues to update this game every single month with updates on what people in the community are up to as well just to keep everybody a little strung together and in the know on what's poppin. Grab some friends play Rust and have fun. will happen.,Rust

You might struggle to keep up if you havent got much free time to dedicate to this game. Between server wipes and just being raided you need to be online or you lose almost all progression. You also need to keep up with updates and changes which happen every week or 2. The community isnt as toxic as people make out. Modded servers are great. The occasional cheater. Good solo but way better with friends. One of my all time favourite multiplayer games I just dont have the time to sink in to it to get anywhere solo.,Rust

So i decided lets take a server with less players the lowest was around 30 aftter loading the game ( took almost 30 minutes) i landed on the beach and decided to lower the graphics down a bit.The game tells you what to do like gather 100 wood and so on i never got to the point of finishing the quest why well the game shows its true color you get killed alot by other players people in full gear and ak 47 or bows that are hunting noobs because they cant fight back and there to scared to lose there gear to other players that are geared to the teeth.Ill call this game the bullies simulator.Iff you like been killed over and over again getting not even to the building base part then this game is for you.Looking around to find stone thinking there are so many mountains and big rocks but you cant mine them no its those weird looking stones with a small sun shining on it those can be mined.Not to mention it takes 100 wood to make a simple wooden spear.You would probebly say why not go to a differend server i did i even encounter a guy who cheated and i got 1 shotted by a ak 47 from far away.I cant recommend a game that has a toxic community that like to kill and humiliate new players iff you die they take your stuff and iff they dont need it they drop it somewhere so it despawns.,Rust

430224,2018-08-21,0,0,246,False,Recommended,I actually do love this game it looks like I have more hate for it than love but thats not true. I may not have alot of hours in this game but I do have the understanding of rust's mechanics. I am a guy who mostly loves FPS games since I was a child and this is just a unique one ( off ark)You start with a rock and a torch you hit some tress down get a stone node get a hatchet and pickaxe build a base and then the rest of the path is in your hands its truly magical what the paths can lead up to but it can be a rollercoaster of emotions.What I love Just pop into a server and start doing what u are able to go from nothing to a king having the feeling of winning 1 v 3 battle raid someone and it actually being worth it learn everything once and be able to craft it all the time until the server wipes actually finding someone who won't betray you (super rare like a shiny pokemon) having people around with an actual mic so you can negotiate something getting your first gun is a incredible feeling having a great start in a freshly 100+ player wiped server not dying getting to the dome top or the water treatment plant parkour the bandit camp has been a pretty good addition in my opinion.well I listed everything I really love about rust theres no way its perfect tho.What I HATE in rust 1) Most of the people in a rust server cause they don't ever use a mic2) When exploring barrels you can get blueprints like 5 or so no one needs them JUST ADD MORE RANDOM BLUEPRINTS FFS THAT ACTUALLY HELP 3) Getting raided as a solo player against 3 fully geared guys who know they wont get materials to break even spending 4k of sulfur (kys but to be fair solo players should stick to solo servers5) optimization of the game is aids I play on very weird and mixed up graphics why cant it just be more simple and understanding for everyone?6)I love losing all my progress by a guy with a semi auto in a server that was wiped 5 hrs ago 7) I mean you still may be in denial about it BUT DONT TRUST RANDOM PEOPLE IN RUST ITS JUST A SCIENTIFIC FACT8) Getting outplayed but a guy with worse gear and beating you is super infuriating9)Compound bow is dog thanks. Nailgun is even better.10) You killed a guy who had a custom smg? TOO BAD FOR YOU SMG BODYS ARE SO ING RARE (not rly green crates just look for places with green crates like Dome top or something casual like a supermarket its a 17% chance for it out of them) SEMI BODY'S ARE SO MUCH EASIER TO FIND LIKE CMON.11) as a wise man once said ' YOUR SKINS' fREAKAZOID 2k1512) Some people say some of the dumbest on the planet in this game no joke. (if they even can talk)13) Getting spawned and chased by a guy with a bow.14) random pernament characters I get what the creator wanted to do with this BUT LET US CHOOSE THAT TO SOME EXTENTIf you want to buy the game 1) actually have a good pc 2) store this on SSD ONLY3)if u have money sure buy it full price I would recommend for a sale tho.4) understand that this will make you a sick degenerate person.5) your gonna want to ragequit a lot but never give up.YEEET,Rust

This is to this day probably the game I've enjoyed most coming on every day and grinding the game for multiple hours on end with friends. It's given me probably the most saddest of times when you farm a full inventory and loose it to a naked with a bow and the greatest times raiding and gaining the best of loot.Atm the stage where it's at the Component/BP stage. It's a game you basically cannot play solo unless you play on a strictly SOLO ONLY server.. Most of the times you'll be killed by 3+ groups while you're roaming around farming or going on scrap runs and it gets pretty frustrating.I would recommend this as a 8/10 for now and i'm still wishing that they renewed the good old bp's.,Rust

430384,2016-07-25,0,0,526,False,Not Recommended,"The last time I reviewed this game I gave it a thumbs up.Now I can't recommend it anymore.The gameplay is fun and challenging base building is awesome and seeing everyones creativity in how they make their base to counter raiders can be very unique and interesting. For most the climatic moment of this game is when you/your group finally has farmed up enough to which you are loaded with gear weapons ammo and C4 and are reading to go out and raid some major base and have a big battle against the Base Home Owners and counter Raiders. For me the climatic moment of this game is after building my base w/ my group the base being put to the test and defending our loot and home against the army of +5 &gt +10 raiders.However overall the community and the games current state ruins it all... AdvancementWant to be geared up with the top notch guns armor and base defenses?1. Find a AK (very rare) (can take hours)2. Farm up a bunch of scrap (can take up to 30mins)3. Research the gun using a blueprint bench w/ your scrap to guarantee blueprint (gun breaks)4. Farm up supplies to make the AK since the last one broke (also rare) (can take hours)5. Craft your AK!Congrats you have a AK!Now do this process again for the AK ammo(s) (regular explosive high velocity) Pistol ammo(s) Thompson Pump shotgun Shotgun ammo(s) Turret Shotgun trap Bolt rifle Sub gun Semi rifle Rocket launcher Rockets C4 Revolver Python Revolver Semi pistol Chest plate Face mask Bucket helmet Garage doors Giant walls LR 300 (Assault Rifle) M249etc.I think you get the point.Unless you're lucky enough to find the blueprint while you're gathering resources it's going to take days to perhaps even weeks before you get even a fraction of good gear equipment and base defenses. All in which time you will likely get attacked and raided and have to rebuild your base and refarm the resources for upkeep.&gt As a solo player that is. If you're lucky maybe you can find a group of players who already have the blueprints that will get you farmed up. But good luck finding a group to join.Solo playing vs Team playingUnless you're a pro the only way to enjoy this game is with friends.&gt The only way to be successful is if you have a group of +2 players.Good luck finding anyone to team with as no one is looking for teammates.If you do manage to find people to team with there's a chance you may be betrayed by them because they joined another team.As a solo noob player good lucking gathering resources to build your base repair the base keep supplying your tool cupboard to keep your base from decaying away and creating tools/weapons to match the other players around you. You'll never make a base that can defend against the groups of dedicated players that farm up C4 all day and are all geared up. while you are still stuck with crossbows / basic weak gun weaponry. You'll never be able to raid your gear back from those dedicated players when their base is huge filled with traps turrets armored walls/doors large walls surrounding it multilayered walls (hunnycombing) etc. as making just 1 C4 can take forever to get the ingrediants for let alone getting the blueprint to be able to make it in the first place and getting the weapons and armor to match fighting the other groups while also being outnumbered etc.ZergsRust used to have an issue with lots of zergs.&gt Aka groups with mass amounts of players that dominate the server.And some servers still have many zergs.Servers have begun countering this by making server rules that are Solo Duo and/or Trio groups only.But this just leads to a new problem in which you have a hard time finding a group to join since everyone is either already maxed or satisfied and untrusting of bringing in new players to their group.Casual vs Pro/DedicatedIf my previous points haven't made it clear already you can't really play and enjoy this game as a casual. This game is a grind fests. Constant farming to keep your base standing while also trying to advance to be able to match the players who have teammates.Closing ReviewI criticized this game when they removed blueprints in exchange for the XP system in which you unlocked blueprints through farming however before the XP system blueprints were not extremely rare and resources to make equipment / weapons were not rare either.&gt It wasn't quick either but getting everything didn't take weeks of farming (solo player).It seems that with every update the developers are trying to find more ways to make players grind. Trying to slow the pace of the game more and more.I used to hop on this game every few months to see the new updates. I would slave for a group until I earned their trust and I would join that group and assist in raids defending farming etc.Now it seems no one is looking for slaves no one is looking for additions to their team.The game does seem to be taking a direction into PvE by adding NPC Scientists and Bandits along with Outposts giving some sort of civilization which adds a Fallout vibe.&gt Hostile Scientists (Blue Scientists)&gt Bandit Outpost (Friendly NPC Bandits but NOT a Safe Zone) and Military Outpost (Green Scientists / Safe Zone)However the NPCs are currently broken with having perfect accuracy.Plus the Attack Helicopter that has been in the game for a while the Tank etc.I know its cliche as everyone else says the same thing but ""the community is toxic"".Its very difficult to find anyone to team with so you'll likely be stuck solo unless you have friends who already own the game or plan to buy the game with you.You won't get far solo unless you become a pro and invest the majority of your life to grinding and playing all day and night.I am hoping for the old Rust to come back.&gt Not Legacy as that is already availableBut I am hoping for team finding to become easier in the future and for this grindfest to be toned back down some.In it's current state find some other game. If you don't have friends to play with this game will be a stressful waste of time bore of a grind...",Rust

Making plays and ing up peoples days ruining lives and adding skulls to my colection. Getting raided geting ganked by a geared AK as a naked with nothing but stone toools and mats to make your base. Rage quiting but getting back on a few minutes later and starting all over. It is literally all the components to fuel the addict lifestlye a rollercoaster. I play solo 99% of the time and I still have a great time. I die frequently and get but keep moving. I go on crazy kill streaks and get tons of loot just to let it sit there. then lose it.

430390,2018-10-30,0,0,428,False,Recommended,Rust It has its ups and downs. While it is a very nice looking game and is fun to play there are a couple negatives to counter it and even the playing field out.Graphics Exceptionally good sunsets are very nice IMO. Large forests and open areas both look beautiful. If you want to pump up your graphics you'll need a pretty nice PC to get acceptable frame rates. Although there are a lot of hardcore players on here to get the best performance PVP wise you need to tweak your graphics to see other players with the best quality.Gameplay Very fun to play with a group of 3 or more. Gives the battlefield more diversity and it allows you to make some admirable plays on enemies. Even larger groups make it hilarious to play as you mostly mess around with eachother and roam. The larger the group the more you dominate. Friendliness is a give and take. Too much friendliness leads to you losing most of your items and gets you killed. But enough friendliness lets you team up with others and can lead to some pretty cool raids or PVP fights. Be careful who you team up with though. Lots of backstabbers in this game that are selfish for loot.This game requires a mid tier amound of farming but that depends on what kind of server you play. The server browser allows you to make your own server as well as choose from modded vanilla and custom build servers. Custom servers let you train and get a feel for what most of Rust is like. This game has its wins and losses. Don't make any stupid moves that you think is logical but could cost you hours of farming. Treat everything with care and make sure you design your base well so it has a better chance against raiders. Location of your base is key if you want to succeed. On the flip side if you're the one raiding make sure you know what you're doing. Explosives are valuable and rare in this game so wasting them will cost you. Make sure your friends are trained to play this game. Watch your back. Have fun playing solo. Community Whoa.I would divide the community of Rust into 5 sections The nice people the zergs the tryhards the toxic and the suspicious cheaters. Everybody except the nice people have a fair amount of toxicity. 10% tryhards 25% cheaters 35% toxic 20% zergs 10% nice people overall. The cheaters will always dismiss that they're cheating and will rain toxic comments down upon you to make them look better. Before I forget There is an overwhelming amount of younger kids on here. They're annoying cocky as hell and get super toxic when you have the upper hand.Early Access That's about it it's in EA. Only problems with this is bugs can be found optimization could be improved and there is a chance of future updates that could ruin the game. That being said about EA let's move on to the PRICE.PRICE It's not worth $35 IMO. If it were a full game with a little bit more content sure. I'd say right now it's worth $20 $25. Wait for it to be on sale. Sure it's fun and it has its moments but this game has been out for 5+ years. TL DR This game is often toxic full of cheaters and little kids but the graphics are pretty nice and gameplay is always diverse giving you hours of endless play. Super fun to play with groups that know what they're doing. The occasional disoriented player in your group is fun too. Just don't let them go out with a full metal kit and an AK.7.5/10.,Rust

430397,2014-04-03,0,0,281,False,Not Recommended,"I used to play this game back in legacy. I loved it then. Now it is a completely different story and nothing but a waste of time in the end. Unfortunately that's how it will always be.This game is a breeding ground for the worst types of behaviors that can come out of people and perpetuates its own toxicity by actively punishing players who try to play without being rude and rewarding players who are. Because of this the community will always be one of the most poisonous and disgusting things that i've ever seen come out of a game.All the things that make this game great... or should I say once did are now what cripples the game. The combat system is fast paced and gets your adrenaline going the downside is that the combat (a VERY large part of the game) is also completely broken. Hitboxes are about as fine tuned as CS 1.6 guns are sloppy and have no actual feel to their weight or usage. The survival aspect of the game is all but gone. Food and water? Nah not important just pick up the hundreds of scattered mushrooms all over the ground and you're set. This once great survival game now no longer has any survival aspect to it the goal of the game is a rush to gather resources and blueprints build a base raid people and then have the server restart two weeks later so you lose your progress. Imagine playing a campaign game GTA V for exmaple getting to the final moments right before the final heist and your game crashes and corrupts your save and makes it unplayable. That is what the game in turn forces on to everyone.Want to know why servers have to restart every two weeks to a month? It's because the game lacks any sort of balance and in the end it corners server owners to have to restart the game so that it ""levels"" the playing field. In reality this doesn't fix anything. Once it's wipe day zergs come to the rescue to loot everything build a massive base and then proceed to raid everyone else without any challenge thus making it impossible for anyone that has a group of four or less to survive and actually progress.TL DR Quick List VERY POOR Optimization Broken Combat Unrealistic Weapons Unbalanced Awful Community NOT NP Friendly ZERGS Galore Overly Complicated For What It Is Lack Of Actual ProgressIf any of that sounds fun to you go ahead and ""enjoy"" the game.

430431,2018-01-18,0,0,377,False,Recommended,I feel as if the game has so much to offer now that I have returned and feel fresh than ever. The game is best played with a team because you can gather resources faster you can farm faster and you can fight others together! Do not get me wrong teams can get defeated if the right player is on the other side of the battlefield. If you are going to be the only one playing you are going to have an issue with the word Zerg (basically a group of people) The game requires strategic playing and awareness very primal survival adds another layer of showing that even if you have just started you can defeat a geared player. You might not like the game at first but a few hours in and you will get the feel that's how everything works. The game is also built off of servers meaning there are servers that are easier than others (loot wise) To wrap this up I have a few more player to player advice The game is a grind you need to play a minimum 5 hours a day to ensure up keep on your base as well as getting weapons PVP and getting loot. Do not rage quit even if you have been farming for 30+ minutes and you get killed it happens to everyone (it's part of the game) you have to be willing to take the risks. To finalize everything I said Great game to kill time kill off people and actually feel amused by taking your hard earned loot and getting better. The game also offers amazing base building where you can store your valuable loot from other players and to craft items. But be careful others can raid it and steal it all!I suggest you watch some youtube videos on the game and see if you like it!,Rust
430432,2018-11-19,0,0,221,False,Recommended,I like this game but i don't like playing for 30 minutes to an hour and having the game lock my entire pc up requiring me to unplug power to it. I like this game due to it being majoraly pvp. I like this game for it's crafting and it's team up or die style of gameplay. I don't like lack of character costomizablity or even things as simple as race or gender. The reason race and gender in this game concern me is that this game has no story that requirs me to be a certain race or gender I am just an anonymouse person in game that does not speak in anything else other than blood curdling screeches upon death. I don't like waiting 5 minutes for a loading screen to be done loading. Even GTA 5 running circles around this games loading screens. I over all rate this game as a 7/10.,Rust

430434,2018-11-06,0,0,206,False,Recommended,This game will be extremely good and enjoyable if you have a couple of buddies that have the game aswell. Rust is a game meant to be played with friends and if you have them you will have a good time but if you dont I cant say the same.Although the community is generally toxic the developers genuinely want and make the game better. They update the game frequently and make it more enjoyable.This is a grindy game so if you dont like grinding it will affect how much you enjoy it but there are modded servers so you dont have to grind as much.BIG WARNING!! If you're using a Mac than it will be laggy as all hell and I recommend you get a real ing computer.(I only know this cause of a friend),Rust
430435,2018-01-20,0,0,270,False,Recommended,"After playing rust for over 250 hours I can safely say that this game is not for everbody. It really appeals to a very hardcore audience.Pros Very Engaging while playing Rust it can feel like time flies by if you are having a great time. I have had a lot of nights were I will get on at 8 00 and I will be shocked to check my phone and have it display the time 11 00. Great Pacing If you can ""get gud"" you can have a base and loot withing a few hours on wipe day and the grind isn't super long and tedious like in other survival games (like Ark). It is all paced so that a small group of maybe 3 5 people can reach end game within 4 days and go raid and have fun for the rest of wipe easy to start Each server in this game has a wipe cycle which means they wipe the server of bases change the map and may clear all learned Blueprints on a regular bases. This makes it really easy to start on wipe day were everybody starts from the ground up and if you don't make very good progress just start again the next week or find a different server that has a different wipe schedule.Cons Toxicity is a huge problem Players in Rust will gladly kill you on sight whenever they see you even if you have nothing. Hell when you spawn on the beach with nothing but a rock and a torch you may be suprised to see another naked trying to kill you just to get your rock. I don't know why people even do this maybe they don't like the way there rock is looking at them so they want yours or they just think ""HAHAHAHA I just killed this other naked with a rock EVERYBODY LOOK AT ME IM A GOD."" Whatever the reason people do it so be prepared. Zergs a Zerg is a huge clan with at least 10 or 13 consistent members that are consistently online. These groups can be really fun to play in and I myself have met some awesome people by joining these clans but going against them is going to make your life a living hell. If you are on an official server solo you are pretty much screwed. You will constantly be mowed down by these groups who accumulate gear like a hoarder accumulates trash. Playing alone is super hard Playing solo is like playing Rust on Ultra Mega Hardcore even for experienced players. If you don't have friends that play rust or can team up with you expect a lot of frustration. The Skill Gap Calling the skill gap between new players and experienced players a ""gap"" is like calling the ocean a puddle. This usually isn't a problem in games because usually experienced players play against experienced players but this is not at all the case in rust. Everybody is thrown onto the same servers which means that you are going to consistently encounter players with 500 1000 2000 or even 5000 hours in the game. They may be nice to you but many out of fear or their twisted ways will try to kill you the moment they see your ugly mug. And often they will succeed in their efforts of turning your skull into another trophy.AdviceBeing a new player can be extremely hard so here are some things that helped me when I first started out Try to get your friends to buy the game If you can get just a few people to buy the game with you then you will have 10x more fun. Even though you may still die and lose progress it will be way less painful if you have some people to support you. Play on a modded server Even though I personally think vanilla Rust is the best way to experience the game playing on a 2x 3x or even 4x server can help you learn the mechanics of the game at an increased rate and with much less punishment for failure. Play on a server that restricts player group size If you are playing solo or with a group up to three playing on a server that only allows for solo duos and trios can eliminate the threat of zergs which is one of the biggest challenges a person can face. ConclusionRust is honestly one of my all time favorite games because of its challenge and mechanics. It can be really fun to try and compete against other players but expect to get your handed to you on a silver platter until you can learn the games mechanics and get semi decent at PvP. All in All I would give rust at least a 8/10 because this game when it comes down to it is a beautifully crafted survival game that is usually spoiled for new players by its community but if you can get past that early frustration you may find yourself loving this game.",Rust

I have been with you since 2014 and it has been an interesting ride.The only con I have is it is too heavy on the Pew Pew Pew and not friendly to builders anymore it would be nice if there was a bonus to the choice of building or FPS when entering a server for each wipe so peaceful builders would be able to get better building stats (with weaker gun stats) while raiders/bandits get better gun stats (but weaker building choices making them better raid targets to raiders). I think it would give a little more life to the non toxic player base. IMO.Thanks guys for over a year (in game) of fun play time.,Rust

Play solo is ultra hard permadeath I hate my life mode. As soon as you understand this lesson you will start to appreciate the game. If you don't you end up like that poor guy from Gamespot and hate it. This game is not beginner friendly but if you master it it becomes the best game you've ever played.Everything you acquire in this game can be taken away. You die people can steal your stuff your base can be raided for all your posessions and after a few weeks the server wipes and everyone looses everything. The joy you get from this game is not permanent achievements a high experience level or constant shooting like other games. It's overcoming difficult situations outwitting and outplaying others. That rush you get when you acquire a powerful piece of equipment and make it home alive is unique and you can't get it in any other game. Just beware the rage when you loose everything is emotionally tilting as well so be prepared ).,Rust

430513,2017-01-24,0,0,1308,False,Not Recommended,I've played this game for 660 hours and as much as it pains me to give a negative review on a game I loved for so long I feel that I have to. This game was VERY good at points. But now it is just people who KOS clans or zergs of people (big groups of people). I still play this game on a regular basis but I can't say I enjoy it. Rust is just a big grind to build a decent base and as an almost solo player (I have a partner who sometimes gets on) it is hard. I get raided atleast once every wipe from a big clan or when I'm offline. It is impossible to defend your base while your offline. I know raiding is one of the key elements of Rust but when a group of 12 people come to raid me there isn't much I can do. Which brings me on to my next point clans. Clans/zergs are a HUGE problem in this game. I can't count how many times I've been roaming and getting destroyed by a huge group of people. FPS is a one of my biggest problems in this game. I have a decent PC GPU 750ti CPU i5 4460 RAM 8gb Ripjaw. It runs most games no problems. I am aware this game is in early access but come on its been 3 years now. I average about 45 FPS with discord and steam only open. That's not including the the ever so often drops to 1 2 FPS I get about every 5 minutes which last a good 10 seconds. I have died so many times from this. I would only reccomend this game if 1. You have friends to play with 2. If you have a decent PC 3. If you know someone with backround knowledge on the game (It is hard to get a grasp on the game by yourself) That is the end of my review but in my situation I can not reccomend this game.,Rust

430517,2018-11-12,0,0,952,False,Recommended,This is a great game depending mostly on pure skill + experience and the situation you are in. Ive always loved waking up on the beach to some random kid screaming while smacking another kid over the head with a rock. The difficulty truly varies between these factors Who you play with What server you play on Your skill and experienceI remember one of my first memories in rust where i didnt know how to make a furnace. Playing a wipe on a server has tought me something new about the game every week ive played. Almost everyone who plays over wipes slowly turns into a cold blooded killer.If you are a new player looking to buy this game or who just recently purchased it watch youtube tutorials teaching you how to start off. You can also learn from a friend who is willing to teach you. Ive tought many friends how to play since they first got the game and its more like a job than a game. All you have to do is listen to your more experienced friends and you will learn fast. There are also many servers that are meant for practice which helped me alot.I recommend this game to dedicated people.,Rust
430518,2018-08-21,0,0,525,False,Not Recommended,No recommendation from me until at least 1 minute is reserved for a disconnected players server slot. No one is able to enjoy this game when there is a random lag spike which causes a disconnect and then forces you to wait half an hour or more in a 30+ player queue while your character in game is laying in the open with 3+ hours worth of work in their inventory. seriously ed. Biggest flaw in this game right after the hard snowballing players can get in the first 8 hours after a Blueprint wipe.... please just add slot reservation for disconnects even if its just for 1 minute.,Rust
430519,2017-06-15,0,0,4037,False,Not Recommended,Now that this game is in full release its time to talk.Rust is a good game in that its polished gets updated and has a dev crew that does care.Rust is a bad game in that the players are TOXIC Racist Hate speech vomiting little toads. If you dont have a giant crew of friends you are at a loss in this game you will NOT build a team from ppl you meet in game for the most part ppl will lie and troll and steal and grief and just be all around terrible to you. There are a few good ppl that play but they are few an far between and often become targets because of this. Hacking isnt uncommon on offical servers on private/community servers its even more common aswell as the ppl that own the server using admin to cheat without hacking.I play solo always have learned everything the hard way. i cant tell you you will like this game i cant tell you it will be fun i can tell you you'll be shocked that parents could raise there kids so poorly.,Rust

I mean look at League Fortnite and all that stuff.the thing is you're playing a surival game and if you're playing alone oh dear i'm really sad for you.You will die and die and die and die and die. there is no limits. No matter if you're carrying a damn rock completely naked hitting a three YOU WILL GET SHOT IN SIGHT IF NOT BY ONE BUT BY GROUPS OF 3 4 5 OR EVEN KOREAN ZERGS OF 10.They have no use for you or your wood or your stone they WILL just kill you for fun.But hey isn't that the premise of the game? Its a pvp survival game right?It is! But the game lacks PVE aspects things that should make people get together a kind of equilibrium to make people decided if they want to cooperate or not and if they don't they would just have a hard time. Armed groups will roam the whole map with Ak's and stuff killing everyone in sight big clans will take over big part of the map and if they know where you live YOU'RE GOING DOWN.I will say it here if you're playing alone you need to be a God a literal GOD. Because you will be bombarded HARD and you WILL crumble. The game wasn't like this before today Rust is just a Zerg simulator. Not that friendship is bad or that overwhelming numbers are wrong as they are all friends they are just playing the game. But be prepared to suffer get frustrated die and lose all of your time in a matter of seconds.

I really do love this game though I find the surprising amount of sociopathic trollish behavior to be frustrating.I love the environment the building mechanics the gathering never feels like a grind.I mostly just play PVE now because I do enjoy the communal aspects and there are less sociopaths in those servers.I wonder if I won't find friends in PVE and one day move forward into PVP but then again I don't like to feel stressed out all the time looking over my shoulder.This game really encapsulates life in a huge way.Above all things I hate about this game...

Then for some reason I found myself watching Rust videos and having got a key in a Humble Bundle a while before though I might as well give it a go. Seem to be pretty hooked so far.

430662,2018-11-22,0,0,859,False,Recommended,I don't know where to start with this game. There are many things that make it so unique and fun but there are a few that get frustrating. Before I start with pros and cons don't buy this game if you don't have a lot of time. This game is extremely time consuming. There are so many things that you'll need to grind for. Your going to end up getting raided and having to grind back everything you had before. This game is not for people who give up easily either. You are going to get killed over and over again by someone who's better that you or just has better gear than you do. It's inevitable. But you have to keep going if you want to have fun. Just hit that respawn button over and over again until you are able to get a start. There's also something called a zerg. They are basically a group of 10+ people who kill anything that moves and are nearly impossible to beat because of their sheer numbers. A good thing about this game is the graphics. They are absolutly beautiful if you can run them. It not opitmized very well but it has gotten better. I'd recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a rewarding and fun open world FPS that doesn't mind doing some farming.,Rust

430665,2018-11-22,0,0,482,False,Recommended,Incredible game that often gets crap for its young playerbase. If you intend on playing with a few friends stick to solo/duo/trio servers as some people no life this game which I can understand because it's incredible. You'll understand once you are able to make a part of a map your home. Then you can make plays against everyone else and take their loot. Then learn their loot in your research table to ue it against them. Soon enough you can control an island.

430669,2017-10-22,0,0,850,False,Not Recommended,First off. I want to make clear this is MY opinion of why i do not recommend to new players.I love rust don t get me wrong with nearly 1k hours over a few accounts.At the current state of rust would not recommend rust because of the simple reason of Zergs and weapon balance. With the AK having learnable recoil you come across people using recoil scripts on the regular. The M249 being uncraftable you would think its balanced right?? Wrong with it dealing 65 damage so you can mow down anything under a Coffee can and having learnable recoil... A hackers wet dream. The bolt is beyond rare and is only used by Zergs having a base the size of a small castle. The MP5 is also terrible and are underpowered and tends to be out DPS'd by AK's or a SAR. Now to Performance My specs are Cpu i7 4790K OC 4.6GHz (H80i)Gpu EVGA 980ti Hybrid SC x2 Ram Corsair Vengeance 16GB With my specs this game runs like A S S with potato mode and gibs turned to the lowest i get around 30 70 depending on the server. Now this problem isnt strictly Rust s fault its more of the servers you decide to play on. Modded servers are the worse with multiplied gathering there are more bases and structures hence the lower fps.In conclusion if you don t have a group of friends to play with and don t mind the current meta and balancing get Rust it s one of the most enjoyable and well developed Survival game out there with regular monthly updates there is always new content to comeback too. But Rust will always be riddled with Zergs specially in Offical.LAPD For lyfe,Rust

There are a multitood of classes to pick from in this game The Bot Terrible at building Terrible at farming can't aim the gun for his life and never gets 20 feet away from the baseThe Farming Bot Not too bad at the game but relies on clan mates for protection but can farm materials quicker than you canThe Builder Can build a hecka beefy base design that's either good at defending while online or is terrible for defending online but good at confusing offliners.The PvPr Mostly older people who only play rust in their spare time and doesn't need clan mates but could use them to distract other people. The Zerg This is a mutiple people class and (usually) are really bad at the game or extremely good. Raids occur day one.The Chad An all around Rust player can lazer beam you at 200m with an AK roams with Incendinary Rounds and mutiple clan mates that either have m249s ir l 96s + aks.The Sweaters These people try hard at everything they do usually raid the second or third day with tons of rockets. Will yell at you if you mess up.The Joker Typically a solo player doesn't take wipes super seriously will play for real on some occasions these are usually really good players that can make plays or really bad players that act this way to hide their lack of skill.The Roof Camper Perhaps an annoying asset to the game espically in a fight but shoot at you from the comfort of their base to prevent their items from being lost. They claim they can shoot from anywhere in the game.Pick it or not this game will eat all of your time if you let it.,Rust

Get killed. You finally get a grasp of what you can craft and build and you'll get killed building your first base. You're smart so you're gonna farm rescources and then immideiatly build a fortified base. You get killed farming. This game is all about having your short life exterminated as unexpected and inconvenient as possible. You get killed just for the fun of it. You might be swimming in water and your foe has no possible way of getting to your loot they'll still shoot you on sight just for sh*ts and giggles. Watch a lot of youtube in advance so you enter the game with some knowledge of how to play. Don't trust anyone. Build a lot of bases because they will get raided when you're offline. The bigger the base the sooner the raid so stay small. I recommend this game but beware In order to not be the bottom feeder you'll have to grind 12 hours a day!,Rust

With the gradual progression system in the form of blueprints there's always something to work for and one of my favourite things about rust are the monthly wipes. It's like a monthly christmas where I get to hop on my favourite game with a few of my friends and feel like i've just bought the game.This game also teaches you to be untrusting and relentless since most of the time you have days worth of grinding to be lost within an instant and anyone can take that away from you.All in all a really intense survival game with some fun pve elements. Would recommend 9/10,Rust
430707,2014-12-27,0,0,639,False,Recommended,"I've been playing Rust since the legacy days and I have a love hate relationship with it. On the one hand You don't get the hardcore survival experience anywhere else. Everything is always on the line confrontation is always just around the corner the game doesn't like to help you and everyone is out to kill you. It has an awesome atmosphere and combat really makes you feel alive You don't respawn close to your killer you don't respawn with any loot. In every gunfight your entire inventory is on the line. Which really helps with ramping up your stress levels. Don't play this game if you hate losing. Because you will lose. Often.But that also makes winning more satisfying. Winning big gunfights and demolishing an entire enemy base is very satisfying and can feel amazingly rewarding. On to the cons Mining and gathering resources can be a chore and sometimes you just want to get some loot up without getting shot by some dude with an AK. Getting raided can be incredibly Also the game has a bad code. The content's awesome but at even the highest framerates the game feels choppy. It's because of bad code they haven't replaced for years. The lighting system is so good and so bad at the same time.... At night campfires look absolutely amazing. Natural lighting or electrical lighting at night looks so god damn good. But without light it's borderline impossible to see anything and the lighting during sunrise/sunset looks very ugly. They changed the lighting system to stop people abusing the ""increase gamma"" exploit which would allow players to up their gamma to be able to see more at night Which is understandable! It's literally impossible to see anything at night especially if you're above someone. Every shape or landscape just turns black. It's quite annoying considering midnight gunfights and raids seem like the most awesome thing ever but in realism they're extremely difficult cause you can't even see what you're shooting.Anyhow this is why I love and hate the game. I'll continue to play it on and off probably until it dies it holds a special place in my heart. Would certainly recommend trying if it appeals to you.",Rust
430708,2017-01-22,0,0,1729,False,Recommended,Rust is not for everyone you have to put in a lot of time for it to be rewarding. While the game can have shaky development and updates that split the playerbase the developers are very good at what they do and try to push the game in the right direction. The game was toxic since 2014 so if you have a problem with it maybe don't buy. If you are on the fence buy on sale.,Rust

430713,2017-01-30,0,0,1615,True,Not Recommended,I used to play this game a lot. That was until they ruined it. The current progression system is ridiculously unbalanced compared to previous ones and the devs don't even acknowledge it and keep adding irrelevant stuff to the game. I'd even prefer the XP system over the current one. At least back then no one had AKs on the 1st day of wipe.Another thing that the devs managed to ruin was the gunplay. It used to be nice and balanced quite skill based where someone skilled enough could take on someone with better gear due to their superior skill. These days this rarely happens because the easier to get move primitive weapons have been nerfed to the grave. Crossbow headshots that used to be able to oneshot a player with a metal facemask if hit in the correct spot now struggle to do 40 damage. The team UI update was another nail on the coffin and has sealed the deal for me.Without significant changes to the progression system I most likely will never play this game again and can't recommend that anyone else should either. It's simply too unbalanced and unfun in its current state. It's a shame really considering how great the game once used to be and how much potential it used to have.3/10,Rust

But I can assure that the experience of this game is the best of all. I can say also that Infestation is garbage and Day Z SA needs lots of improvements. Also the graphics of this game are awesome and they're even running very well on my Nvidia Geforce 9800 GT(AND IT IS ON ALPHA TESTING). I've watched Nether and I didn't like the gameplays of that game but nether has other logic(and as I said I didn't like it).So in my opinion RUST is the best optionGood Simple and complex system of crafting. Beautiful graphics. No lags. There are not many bugs Very good gaming experience. Hardcore SurvivalBad Some minor fixes should be made. Some things should be added to this game(like the option to destroy our buildings).2018 The game is awesome and keeps getting updates however it takes a lot of time to load even if you have an SSD. Also I get framedrops even with good pc specs and with settings lowered.,Rust

I personally loved grinding for materials and building up bases with my friends. Building and gathering is what got me hooked on Rust but other random players is ultimately what made me stop playing. Even on ""noob friendly"" servers I was getting raided almost daily and if I didn't log on for a day or two my base would have a wall or doors blown out and all my hard work would go to waste. On normal servers people immediately kill on sight even if you're naked with no supplies. People will also camp bases and make it their mission to murder you as many times as possible and take all your stuff even if it's just a rock. One time my friend was wrongly accused of raiding someone's small starter house and they mercilessly killed her and then me as well. Other players' toxicity and general want to kill everyone in sight really put me off. Overall Rust is fun but just be ready to have your heart and soul absolutely crushed when some bloodthirsty vindictive monster comes along and takes and destroys everything you worked days for.

The toxic community is highly amusing and I have made many good friends through playing. It is well balanced in that there is not too much grind if you want to get to mid tier but the difference between the mid tier grind and the high tier grind is large. The best thing about the game is the developers and their now monthy updates which constantly bring new features to the game there is nothing I enjoy more than reading the Devblog.

But if you find a good server and play with a group you will get endless hours of enjoyment out of this game. Each wipe has it's own exciting possibilities and keeps the game interesting along with the constant updates and love from FacePunch.In the current state of Rust there is bit more of a grind for gear and resources then previously (unless you are good at PVP and snowball). So be aware you will have to put some time into this game to keep up with others on the server. However you will likely find that Rust holds your attention with the building raiding social (or toxic) and sandbox elements that keep this game exciting.,Rust

One suggestion is that the game should adjust the advantages all you have to do is not die as you gather enough materials to build your base and chance of surviving but the problems that I have in the mod free comunity servers were only with health and the amount of overpowered players that you spawn beside it is just very hard to stay away from players and all you is die. The last thing is that everybody has so much health that is also one of the problems with the overpowered people.,Rust
430772,2018-10-23,0,0,852,False,Not Recommended,The curve of this game is so steep that in order for you to have an understanding of what you're getting into when you start playing you need to either experience constant failures or have an experienced player who is willing to teach you thousands of things.This game could be good but it is definitely not good. After a 10 minut eloading screen with no sense of when you're about to actually load in lag often occurs every time anything serious happens making even the hardware curve way too steep for an enjoyable experience.Just yesterday my game forcibly closed 10 15 times in about a 4 hour window of time. Sometimes the game would freeze while I am simply replying to another player in the in game chat other times it freezes when I have 1000 scrap on me and im crossing a very exposed river causing me to get raided due to disconnect.My video settings are on potato and I have everything turned off (EVERYTHING) and have everything turned to to 50% that can be. The only thing I didn't change was the draw distance because I assume (the game doesn't tell you of course) that that would affect how far I see other players which I left alone.With potato quality and everything on the lowest settings possible I can't understand why my game closes so often that I now expect it to close 2 3 times per hour of actual game play.Seriously beyond the toxicity and near impossible defense against zergs and random trolls that are literally destroying your game this game simply doesn't hold up like any other game like it.I have never seen graphics become such an issue.What a shame I wasted my money and time playing this game. This game should go back in development until you stop seeing 20 recent complaints per day about how this game doesn't play on peoples' computers short of a beefed up Alienware.UPDATE DEC. 7 2018 Decided to get back into Rust because after a reinstall it was working better.Played for 6 hours until I got disconnected due ot the Dec. 7 update. After restarting my PC the game no longer works. I can't load into a server. I have tried 3 modded servers 2 official servers and even the Intoxicated battleground one. NONE will let me load in. The game freezes before I can wake up.How did the game go from being to not being able to load at all? Seriously they got my money. And this is what I get? You ruin the game I paid for months after the fact? How is that even legal? I was literally just playing it before you forceably updated it to a non working condition. t and no refund is to be expected. They can just ruin the game and make it unopenable.I contacted support for help about this and they sent only one email one day later saying to verify the game files. That's all they told me. So of course I had already done that and re installed Rust and reinstalled Steam nothing. Sent them 3 update emails to my ticket and it has been 5 days now no reply.I guess Facepunch just chooses when they feel like helping certain owners of Rust and when they decide some you should just sit at home wishing you could play your game but cant. Is this part of the games' challenging meta?Unacceptable.,Rust

But then that would pretty much mean half the people who play this game don't have an opinion which is kind of sh!t. Some of the best pvp i've ever experienced in a game due to its fast pace and now all I do is play combat tags. But I think everyone can agree that some kind of nerf needs to happen on zergs and clans I even have a few ideas one what to do about the problem like 1. Upkeep depened on how many sleeping bags are in that base and the size of the base This will force zergs to have more than one base and reward people who do not play in outrageous numbers I think if there are more than 3 5 bags in a base the upkeep should increase.2. Make the green dots above teamates invisible until you hover your mouse over them for 2 seconds This will reward good zergs for comunication and will punnish the unorganized zergs with the two seconds Thoose are the only two I can think of right now but comment some more suggestions below Anouther thing that needs to happen is that scrap costs should be lowered. The reason why they're so high is to stop big clans from getting everything day one and to have a sense of progression but since their so high all it's doing is encourging claning and punish small groups of 2 or 3 for not having 8 people grinding for scrap and lets be honest clans are still going to get everything on day 1 or 2 so you might as well just help the smaller groups and lowering it just by a little (like the revolver to 50 scrap semi rifle to 200 or 175 and the Assault rifle down to 650 or 550 scrap) Then optimization should be a bit better (and no my pc isn't . My pc has the reccomended specs on the store page but still gets lag on official servers like rustafied long two weeks into wipe. But after that I think rust is a really good game and most of the problems are somewhat easy to fix I think. If you are planning on purchasing this game do it on a good sale (40% off).,Rust

You can never get it back unless you make a new one or take it back. And each server can reset which means that what ever you have built is lost and you have to start from scratch but it lets everyone have a chance and this can happen either once a week or every two weeks once a month etc. overall I enjoy this game but for my personal opinion it s best played with friends only because everyone else has their friends and will try to kill you and loot you.,Rust

430815,2018-12-13,0,0,10,False,Recommended,First of all Rusts community is possibly the worst community you have ever seen in any game. Even regarding that it is a PvP survival game. There is like not a single friendly player which i don't expect to be honest but would be a nice thing to see. I think people are confused and think that Rust is a Battle Royale you'll often see fresh spawns killing each other for literally the sake of the kill and nothing else.Nevertheless Rust is a well made game. The community surely isn't the fault of the developer and i like the quiet times in the game when you're just farming with you friend as well as the casual reasonable fights between me and another player. Rust would be a seriously nice game to play if it wasn't for this community.I think Rust doesn't deserve a thumbs down for the community because it really is a good game. Thumbs up to the developers but thumbs down to everyone who has this game. And yes even thumbs down to myself and my friends. The toxicity is infectious and since everyone is doing it we also started to kill every single living being on a server. In the end buy it or do not. Just keep in the community in mind. It's not that there is this one player on the server who always trolls you the whole server trolls itself.Final rating 7 out of 10,Rust

You start with nothing and try to get the best gear you can by whatever means possible.This game will make you feel every single emotion except love. There is no love or trust in Rust. There is anger surpise happiness boredom anticipation fear etc. And you can experience all of this within mere minutes. You're going to build up a sweet base in a great location and get your chests full of good items then you're going to lose it all and you have to be okay with that or else you're going to hate this game. You're going to have to start over and over again and everytime you get more anxious. But when you finally get in a position to pull of a sweet play and kill someone with loot it's a wonderful feeling and you'll want more and more of it. You can't be scared in this game or else you'll have a bad time. You have to walk around with your in your hand and a spear in the other ready to ruin someone elses day.

Yes at times rust can be fun and occasionally you may meet someone who seems to not be totaly toxic they may be a nice person but more times than not prepare to get killed on sight or offline raided by your new ""friends""People will offer to help new players and give them free stuff now by all means accept the help take the free stuff but don't put no trust in strangers and never bring someone to your base no matter how helpful they are they will raid you the moment you log off or go afk.

430909,2018-12-20,0,0,1202,False,Recommended,Rust..It's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance so when you're spotted by an idiot you'll start hearing the talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer they get louder and more confident and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun blasts while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults. The auditory experience is both fantastic and haunting. They have made changes to make it somewhat not so stale from the birth of the game. It is both frustrating and rewarding.

Unless you have a dedicated server a dead server or sheer luck Rust will not be a fun experience for you. You will be killed on sight by anyone no one is willing to help you 99% of the players are toxic as hell and the gameplay bone dry. Besides the giant performance issues the Unity engine brings forth and also the downright unusable mess of the chat system there's little joy in running for your life for 15 minutes trying to gather the minimum supplies to create a pickaxe or hatches. By the time your naked body is covered in maybe some gloves or something for your feet you'll be dead. Or at the very least starving. Or being shot at... Or being set ablaze... Lets not forget that if you're a beginner with no idea what to do you'll be given no help by fellow players and they'll just taunt you with such things as ""I love killing nakeds"" and ""If I see you I'll kill you for 1 scrap"".

The graphics are actually really good and even though they could use some work im really impressed by them. However graphics arent what matters when it comes to a good game the real thing is the gameplay. In Rust there is a lot of PvP and PvE as you will have to fight to survive against many different challenges such as other players Mutants and Wolves/Bears. This game is highly addictive as i have said before even though the console/commands could use some work because they arent that easy to use I recommend this game. I could see a great future for this game. UPDATED REVIEW AS OF 2018 NO NO NO NOTHIS GAME IS TRASHDO NOT PLAYSTAY FAR FAR AWAYEVERYTHING GOOD HAS GONEEVERYTHING BAD HAS REMAINED,Rust

431039,2019-01-02,0,0,329,False,Recommended,This game is everything I expected it to be. Challenging exciting frustrating fun and strategic all rolled into one. I joined and started playing this game a few days on the Rustopia US Main after it did its weekly wipe. Don't expect to progress very far since most of the player base is established already with prime locations and etc. Also be prepared to die...A LOT. There is a lot of grieving and toxicity so if you get your feelings hurt easy then this isn't the game for you and you should move on to something less...evil. The one thing I did see is immediate bans for homophobic and racist comments...that alone is a huge improvement. I applaud that. They receive bad marks for allowing anyone under 18 in the game though. There are many underage members. The graphics and sound is very nice. For being a DayZ clone these guys did a bang up outstanding job. The only thing that I would probably be critical of is not letting new players understand what exactly they are getting into. It would also be nice for them to open up a newbie server that focuses more on game mechanics and understanding them versus just going around and cannibalizing everything and everyone for the LULZ.I hope this is helpful. I'm a friendly in game if you see me feel free to join my little community. ),Rust

431074,2018-09-12,0,0,751,False,Recommended,I wrote a review back in 2017 on my main account. But now I've got a broader understanding of this game and I've played offical for enough now. So here is my 2018 review on rust.The game is super fun even after having nothing and starting over again with a rock in hand. But it's as toxic as it's ever been. And not gonna lie i'm really toxic as well. But I think one of the biggest problems in this game with offical servers. Is asians and hackers. Asians don't have any servers so you have them come to the Australian servers so it's really hard to communicate. And hackers are everywhere there flying around instant doming people raiding people exactly where there loot is. It's really annoying. Edit 23/12/2018I was playing on Facepunch 2 Official back in the day which was filled with Asians. I've moved on and there isn't that much once you move other offiicial servers There are still asians but not alot. Don't have a problem but it's a lot of Asians are hacking/hard to communicate with or in big zergs which makes the game a bit unfun at certian times. but if you can get past that your good. The optimization is terrible in this game and I have to play on Potato graphics with a 1050ti and a i7 to keep my frames during PvP Also has anyone noticed the decrease in frames and good animations over the years? Just a quick thing to point up But at this current state of the game I give rust a 8/10.I'm going to rewrite this review at a later date. please leave any constructive ideas in the comments that I could address in my next review.,Rust

However now I decided to try it again so I bought it again (cause I lost my old account) and I can definetly say it's worth the price. Keep it up devs!!,Rust

You will die a lot at first but if you avoid the starting areas and congested areas you'll have a much calmer funnier time. Build up your bases tech tree Unlock new techs through research and discovered blueprints. Survive attacks on both you and your base. Explore ruins and find chests. Go scuba diving and explore sunken ships. Avoid military base tanks Fly in a balloon with fuel you crafted. Drive a boatsCons See more racial slurs than you've ever seen outside four chan. (four chan is a censored word in Steam? LMAO)Basically if you can be an adult and ignore all the toxicness and avoid congested areas you can put TONS of hours into this game and have a lot of fun. Having friends to play would be a great advantage but I've been doing solo and I've hit 32 hours in like... 4 days. I can't stop binging on this game.TIP There ARE toxic people here. This game is a ""Sociopath Simulator."" Everyone is cruel. BUT if you CHOOSE to take the highroad other humans WILL find you and you'll make friends.

431119,2018-11-03,0,0,1929,False,Recommended,rust is a unique survival game were instead of it having balenced pve and pvp it has little pve that impacts you game and makes it a heavy pvp based game that pushes the knowledge and skill of both you and the people around you. Think of it as as minecraft and csgo combined. the reason for saying minecraft as the building aspects are pretty much borrowed but instead of breaking down your base you spent 2hrs on you can simply just upgrade without breaking a simple item with in your fortress. another borrowed aspect of minecraft is the crafting but you have to find the items within a radtown/momument to make more of it and you have differenet tiers of crafting tables which are called workbenches you have a workbench level 1 (which is used to create more basic equipment) the workbench level 2 (which allows more advanced items like sub machine guns or rifes and more advanced base defences like auto turrets) the workbench level 3 (which allows the most advanced armor assult rifes sniper rifes and advanced raiding materials like c4 and rockets). the csgo aspect of rust is of course the guns every gun has a recoil pattern and spread (which can make or break you) an example of recoil (which happens to be the highest recoil in the game) is the ak https //www.youtube.com/watch?v xqXFfFjLlkw this video will so you how the ak recoil looks like other guns are much much simpler than this so if the ak is to much try its counter part the lr 300 but weapons like the lr 300 are uncraftable but can be bought (for scrap this game is not p2w),Rust

431123,2016-04-09,0,0,3298,False,Not Recommended,I have mixed feelings for this game. I love the game but on the same time Im worried about how long time it will take and have taken to get it out of early access. It's been almost 5 years now since they started this game and it's believed to be out of early access in february 2018 even though I think it's far away from done.. Excepts from that I find it to be the best pvp survival game on pc currently there arent many survival aspects in the game but the interesting gun play and hard to master game mechanics make this a game that you will have tons of hours in. Just make sure to play with a fellow gamer or else you will have a tough time!EDIT 5 years after the game got published and 10 months since it left release on feb 2018 There are alot of things In this game that I find to be gamebreaking such as the helicopter shooting nakeds with bows (even when not being agressive). It really shows how much the devs care about the game..,Rust

431163,2018-12-27,0,0,967,False,Recommended,At the time of this review I have more hours on Rust than any other game in my Steam library. Suffice it to say that I would not have put in this much time in without giving it a favorable review. That being said a lot has changed in Rust over the years most noticeably the toxic atmosphere created by kids that don't get enough attention from mommy and daddy. This is slowly eating away at the enjoyment of the game. This game is heavily focused on PvP but with the recent introduction of electricity more PvE servers have popped up and it is being compared to Minecraft. minus the blocks and editable terrain.If you like creative games but hate PvP then you will be torn with this game because the creative aspect that you can apply to building a base is great. On the other hand if you like PvP *AND* creative games then you will love Rust because not only can you be creative with your builds but you can make your builds functional too and even moreso with the electrical update.If you're new to Rust or about to purchase choose a small community server to learn on before attempting any of the official servers because the official servers are the most toxic and the constant KOS you will face will make it difficult to learn the basics.,Rust

I killed one player Then made a spear some clothes then got shot in the head If your the new guy you will die a lot. The guys with the heavy gear just chase you down and kill you left and right. Someone is always out to get you. Not a very fun game. I am very good at pvp by the way just cant be bothered running around dying 100 times to try and get better gear.

I try to contact support and they are just bots no help what so ever. They need to stop pushing updates if they aren't even fixing the problems users are having i look online alot of people have the problem i am having. They need to start fixing the game before pushing content updates the game is a waste of money if the development team won't fix the bugs and errors that the game is having with its users.BUG Everytime I go to join a server any server it loads in then crashes before i can even spawn in.,Rust

431233,2019-01-09,0,0,145,False,Recommended,Great Game!Rust is a great game and although I m new to it I feel like I ve been playing forever and it s always a thrill when you snowball but always sad when you lose everything (especially when people offline) but there are 2 issues I find in the game that make the experience less pleasing 1. One of the newer guns the L96 is really Over Powered And is easy to get (bandit camp) so I think it should get either a nerf or should no longer be sold at bandit camp2. The group system is great for telling who is friendly and who is not easier but it also has friendly fire meaning that a small group can add a new member who then gains their trust and kills them for all their stuffMaybe this is just me being salty over the amount of times these two things have gotten me back to square one maybe others feel the same but I feel that (especially the first one) these issues should be dealt withThanks ArrowBoi,Rust

431274,2016-01-08,0,0,2072,False,Not Recommended,Ive played this game alot... all the way back to legacy. Its awesome... adrenaline filled and great with friends. Facepunch studios have put their heart in soul in to the game. This game keeps you thinking about it even when you aren't playing. Everything is about Rust. The only problem is the community. A summarization of the general pop of Rust above 300 hours just want to be MLG PvP gods and will one day be a Youtube/Twitch sensation... Even on small community servers where most are just looking to have good fun/competition in the world of Rust. Naked/low geared players automatically assume when they come into contact with another player that they will kill them. No talking just shoot on sight or a young boy screaming at the top of his lungs possibly doing both.The worst poeple are the ones who commit all of their free time to the this game. They are usually angry sexually frustrated or trying to live the dream of once becoming MLG Rust famous. If you kill these types of players by some chance they will usually make a threat to raid you when you go to bed. You can stay up till 4am but it doesnt matter. They having nothing outside of this game and will most likely have to start again until you or your friends quit till next mid month wipe.I dont think a talk with the community will work... its more of a cancer.Long live the old BP system and Rust 2015 to 2016.P.S.

Since the arrows have travel time the dont always hit but when on melee or when thet get guns or even a crossbow its a headshot festival.DONT BUY IT RIGHT KNOW !!!BUT This is a very good game. The survival aspect. The crafting/building... The struggle for suvival what's makes you build a base farm resources fortify and raid others for resources and guns. The drill of look around and never fell safe. The drill of defend what is yours and to claim what is not yet yours. It's a great game. Still on Beta but the developers are very active and keep the community informed about their work.The downside is like others FPSs games (the PVP on rust is kinda any other FPS out there) there is hacks but they are isolated cases and the hackers usually dont last long.,Rust

431318,2016-06-09,0,0,718,False,Recommended,Too many hackers. Official servers have no admins to help the players. The devs ignore these issues. Very fun game with friends but the official servers are awful as far as administration goes. People will be kicked like 5 times in the hour over movement violations and are still allowed to play and possible fly hack into peoples bases.Would not recommend until Facepunch either ups their anti cheat program or provides active and useful administration to their offical servers.Gameplay is clustered and scatter brained as well balance and PvP is a mess. Devs have been trying to find something that sticks after three years. Game optimization ranges between catastrophic and acceptable. Recommended SIXTEEN GB of RAM and the game installed on an SSD.There is so much potential for a great game under all the issues. The devs constantly dream of interesting and fresh ideas but are either left on the white board or are implemented and require months of bug fixing.I do want this game to be good. I only criticize because it could be a stellar game.*** EDIT JANUARY 11 2018 ***Most of my complaints that reduced my recommendation have been resolved. Most servers official and otherwise have effective anti cheat. Game optimization has improved to the point where mid range PCs can play it comfortably. Gameplay loops haven't changed much over the years guns are still overpowered as is offline raiding. However there is a great amount of fun to be had. It is a simple pleasure to harvest resources make and protect a base and screw with random folks on the server. Would recommend. Very good with friends.,Rust

431320,2019-01-06,0,0,5,False,Recommended,"It may be considered a game in the genres of survival and building (I think its close to 7 Days to Die and such).You start naked only with a stone (which is your first tool to get stone wood etc.) and a torch. Nothing else. With this is you gradually try to get ressources feed yourself defend yourself and make a base. Within this base you can make research and get to better materials (eg. iron using a furnace etc.) and therefore better equipment.There are also NPCs that may make your life harder (depending on where you are on the map).This is not too bad. I have seen better games in that regards but certainly worse. It is rather intuitive and the tutorial rather easy to grasp. The graphics are pretty and on the ""comic"" side but in my opinion fit pretty well.You can play it solo (haven't tried that though) and with friends (hosting your own server). In my opinion this is the only way to play it. Playing it with friends might be considered fun even though it may take away (some at least) the challanges of PvP.There are community servers (non official server for public access) which may also worth taking a look.Playing on an official server (you need to play there to get the steam achievements) can only be considered toxic. It's pure PvP with no rules and absolutely no noob friendlieness at all (noob meaning here new on the server with no functioning base).It took me over 32 deaths I stopped couting after that all within 3 to 4 minutes to get TWO single achievements (getting scrap from barrels and destroying barrels. Afer each death you start over naked with no materials and somewhere else on the map (not even close).Naked me got attacked by other nakeds and by others fully equipped with automated weapons. All out of nowhere no interaction what's'o'ever. Within these few hours only ONE single player gave me an iron hatchet and left me alone.So ....if you like this kind of challenges....go for it and play on official servers. I can't recommend it. Fortunately there are other options )",Rust

431322,2019-01-05,0,0,227,False,Recommended,So Rust over the years in beta suffered alot of setbacks. From deers deciding to scale mountains to run away to people building a massive tower and jumping into your base. However since full release in Feb it has greatly improved and i give the Devs credit. They fixed optimization issues dead spots in the landscape glitching characters gun lagging and everything else. The game runs so much smoother and they added tons of side events which makes you feel like you arent doing the same thing over and over again like in wave games or MM. They also routinely speak to the players about both present and future updates. Even with the price increase i would recommend this game especially to group gamers. This is such a relaxing yet vigorating game and im looking foward to future updates.,Rust

Playing solo is the most boring thing and takes so long to be able to do anything that gets to the fun. Having 2 3 friends hop on make memes plays and raiding is what makes this game the most enjoyable for me. Yes running around role playing can be fun for a night or two but when getting down to the mechanics of the game it doesn't like the solo player.,Rust

It is not well optimized and has a massive amount of glitches. If it ever goes on sale its a great game to play with a friend or two but solo can be enraging and is rarly fun.

If you've ever played minecraft think of it like that except add on alot more murderous players explosives such as rockets and c4 and the occasional helicopter to come shoot you down if your not indoors. dont forget the animals as even a chicken can kill you. Rust is a open world type of game where you gather materials and build a base and then fight off other players to protect this base or you go destroy somebody elses base and take whats rightfully yours. Yes as some reviews say there are negatives. being(1) Hackers are lurking around corners left and right. but most of the time the modded and community servers do a good job of banning these snot nosed kids quickly.(2) As a solo player you will struggle in this game. yes your going to get raided alot. yes your going to get shot down by multiple people ranging from a 2v1 to a 6v1. but it is quite fun to be doing your own thing with nobody else to disturb you.(3) i see some people complaining about faulty admins. yes your correct these admins will most likely be abusive but also if you join a server with ""ranks"" on it like urusty servers in modded you'll notice the admins actually arent allowed to play the game at all they just watch players for cheating. there are several servers like this and a way to find them quickly is just looking through and seeing if they have ranks or a store or something like that.Overall if i had to rate this game 1 to 10 i would give it a solid 8.5 graphics are nice i like that you can vary the graphics in the launcher depending on your pc the voicechat is very nice to communicate with other players ( toxic or not ) And this game is special. as all servers wipe bringing you a new fresh map with new people daily which is what i personally believe is why so many people play rust and keep coming back to it week after week.",Rust

431339,2017-06-24,0,0,410,False,Recommended,I made a review on this game back in april when i went on my run of making reviews for certain games I played. I am rewriting it since a lot has changed in 8 months. First this game is still one of the hardest games for new players on steam but is rewarding when your skill level gets higher and higher. I used to be hot at this game and after 300 hours i know consider myself half decent at aiming. This game is a perfect blend between realistic survival and arcadey survival. The hardest task in this game is 'soloing' or playing by yourself but i have made plenty of steam friends via this game. Overall some of the new additions like the ship and military transport helicopter that were not relavent when i did my first review are great additions. However some like the electronics and traps added very recently seem to be a needless chore like a minecraft mod. This game is fantastic and easily lands a place in the top five of my most favorite steam games of all time and if you can get it for a good price like $25 or so buy it however you will need a beefy computer to run the game fair warning.

Running Rust on a Lenovo can be tough but I so far have not had problems I simply set my graphics to the lowest mode and it shockingly allows me to play. Having presently played the game for about 4 hours I've seen my share of the Rust stereotypes. Rust has a toxic but loving community. Small servers have their own communities which thrive and build off of friendship and adventure. At first I was introduced to the game by a friend then it evolved into constant bindging of Rust youtube videos. And let me tell you playing the game is so much more fun than watching the game!

431379,2017-07-04,0,0,1091,False,Not Recommended,Update 01/01/2019 This game is trash and you should avoid it as a solo player or someone who has a small group of friends as you won't stand a chance against the zergs or the hackers. Not recommended.Rust is one of those games which you either love or hate. It depends on whether or not you can blend in with one of the most toxic communities in all of gaming. People seem to misunderstand this for a cooperative survival game. This is NOT for people who are looking to be friendly and live peacefully. This is an intense PVP game thats meant to make you mad.1. A very small portion of the Rust community is friendly. This game seems to turn most of us into complete s2. You will die a lot. 90% of the people will be to you and kill you on sight even if you got nothing.3. You will get salty over losing some good loot that took you a while to collect. This will occur multiple times.4. Someone (Sometimes huge clans) will always raid your base while you're online or while you're sleeping.5. The optimization of this game is simply awful in it's current state. Make sure you play on lowest settings.My suggestions to enjoy Rust 1. FInd a friend to go duo with if you're new. Solo is usually insanely hard for new players (especially on official servers)2. Try out Low pop community servers or High rate modded servers to get a hang of the game.3. Modify and change your mindset to become a complete to everyone else to feed on their salt.4. Git gud. It takes a lot of practice and experience to build a proper base and use weapons effectively.And finally try to learn to let things go. If you die with your best rifle or a crap ton of resources don't get mad. That's what everyone else is looking for to make people rage quit. Just make an effort to farm it back and get some sweet revenge!Coming to my final verdict,Rust
431380,2014-03-19,0,0,1485,False,Recommended,Great PvP game that is very rewarding to those who have skill or put in effort to improve their skill. It is definitely an unfair game if you do not understand what's going on such as different styles of servers like solo/duo/trio and keeping up to date which days the servers wipe. You will most likely have no fun if you join mid/late week so it's important to learn wipe schedules. Playing solo is very stressful you will die a lot but it is possible to do this alone once you learn how to pvp or avoid confrontation. This game can take a lot of your time up but you can play modded servers that will speed up gameplay so you can have fun over a weekend instead of grinding for a week straight. Highly recommend this game if you love PvP. This game has a lot of negative reviews because I don't think people understand that the main goal is to kill each other and they try playing it as a survival game. Which it is but to survive against your neighbors.,Rust

After owning this game for a few years it is no longer that.

431436,2018-12-04,0,0,673,False,Recommended,I ve played about 200 hours on rust and I can easily say it is the best survival/crafting game I have ever played. I really enjoy the concept of spawning into a desolate wasteland having to deal with animals other players scientists and numerous other things in order to survive. I absolutely love the crafting system and base building system. I have played games that have had similar building mechanics in them but there is just something about the way rust employs these mechanics that really take the cake for me. I enjoy how you can choose numerous different servers to match your play style whether it be intense pvp or limited pvp week wipes or monthly wipes. The choice is yours and it is nice to see a game give you this decision to make. I would full recommend this game to anyone looking for a very enjoyable experience. 10/10,Rust

431438,2018-12-20,0,0,1472,False,Recommended,I've been playing rust since it came out (legacy). I have to say this is the best game I've ever played. The devs truly love the game and you can see that with their almost weekly updates for half a decade now. The game has come such a long way and is continuously getting better. I play solo which is a huge challenge but part of why I enjoy it so much. This game is not for the weak and will require that you learn A LOT before making huge progress but ultimately it is so rewarding to see your hard work come to fruition. The game also compliments people with various play styles. If you are a creative person that likes to build bases set up traps and strategically get ahead then you can do that. On the other side if you like to PVP and progress through getting other peoples loot that you kill you can do that as well. Rust truly is the closets thing to real life in a game.,Rust

It's a good game if you're good at PVP or if you enjoy base building and trap building. You can also take down a helicopter or try take the loot from a cargo ship that randomly spawn. I give it a 9/10 based on it's current version. I recommend this game for everyone to play. I personally play the Rust Alpha 5X Icefuse Server and it's a very cool community.

Clans on vanilla have 4 12 people so yeah don t try to solo.Why do i recommend it?

Community Not really a community Toxic Somewhat Toxic Normal Friendly Extremely FriendlyThe community is less toxic than csgo but if you play on the right server expect to be offline raided constantly its almost impossible to play for a long time without a crew. The community is also really helpfull at times. if you need help with a certain item there will be some people who will help you find or use that certain item. Audience Kids Everyone Casual players Pro playersRust has imediate nudity the second you load into the game. I would not advice your children 13 (Under) to play this game. There are alot of guns and raiding blowing up things if you are a liberal and you want liberalism to run in your family dont let this game be purchasesd. Graphics Potato Really bad Bad OK Good Beautiful MasterpieceThe graphs are really good. at times it can look super realistic but the building mechanic can really take you out of it. other then that dont expect extra wrinkles on character model. Nothing like FarCry 5 and JC3. Price/quality Free Full price Wait for sale Average Refund it if you can Don't buy itPersonaly i would wait for a sale. the game is too much for a Build&amp Shoot Simulator. but if you have friends who are willing to play with you i would absolutly buy it at full price.

431534,2019-01-01,0,0,83,False,Recommended,I was banned from this game all the way back when only Legacy existed. Now im not hear to make a case or statement outright i blatantly cheated. I did however purchase the game on a different account and have been enjoying it ever since. More now than ever does Rust give a unique feeling when playing. The loot you carry actually has value to you mostly in the form of time and losing or gaining loot is either a huge crash or a pumping surge of adrenaline. Nothing feels better than raiding a base for a case full of weapons and explosives. Rust isnt without its flaws obviously the community is extremely toxic and it can feel disheartening for new players or small groups when a 10 man zerg marches over their base. With this in mind though there are still many positives to the game. Rust has an active dev team that is fully committed to the game and ships monthly updates that can change the landscape of how the game is played and while a good majority of Rust's player base is toxic there are a few individuals who you may make a connection with and then who knows!Side note Thank you to all the devs who have put in the effort to make the game what it is today and thank you for all of your hard work it does not go unappreciated. Much love to daddy Helk keep being a meme!,Rust
431535,2018-10-18,0,0,1837,False,Recommended,Yes I waited over 1600 hours over the course of four years to write a review.Rust is the best game if you're not faint of heart and enjoy high risk high reward gameplay. Rust does not hold your hand but gives you the tools to pretty much do anything you want. With enough charisma you can create whole communities of strangers set up shops and sell items for the materials you need to maintain your base. If you and your friends are good at PvP you can roam the map and hardly farm anything at all. If you're sneaky (and you'll have to be) you can run solo around the map and into monuments which is some of the riskiest and most thrilling gameplay.You will die a lot. You will get extremely frustrated. Morale will get very low. The eventual big victory is totally worth it whether you successfully defend your base from a raid defeat another group of players in the wild drive another hostile group out of the area or even put up a damn good fight as an underdog in a losing battle.The devs are some of the most active I've seen for a survival game. New content is pushed out regularly and it works as intended most of the time. Whatever small bugs exist are quickly fixed. They also do not compromise on their vision of the game. There are plenty of people (carebears) who have pushed them to make it more forgiving but they haven't budged very much in this regard. They know the game they're making and the niche it fills.Get the game. Git gud. Bring your friends. Make some friends. Take over the map.,Rust

Whisk together one egg one egg yolk and a little milk taken from the 300ml then pour into the well. Whisk with a little of the flour.Gradually whisk in half of the remaining milk drawing in the rest of the flour a little at a time to make a smooth batter. Stir in the remaining milk. Cover and leave to stand for about 30 minutes.Heat the frying pan and brush with a little oil.Ladle two or three tablespoons of batter into the pan and tilt the pan so that the batter spreads out evenly over the bottom.Cook the pancake over a medium high heat for 45 60 seconds until small holes appear on the surface the underside is lightly browned and the edge has started to curl. Loosen the pancake and turn it over by tossing or flipping it with a palette knife. Cook the other side for about 30 seconds until golden. Slide the pancake out of the pan.Heat and lightly grease the pan again before making the next pancake. Serve the pancakes as they are made or stack them on a plate and reheat before serving. (If the pancakes are hot when you stack them they will not stick together there is no need to interleave them with greaseproof paper.)Total time40 minutes,Rust

You start on a server build a small base get a bunch of stuff log off for the night come back on in the morning and see you were killed damn near 2 hours after you logged off so then you go to youtube look at some base desgins you copy them and it last for about a weeks then that god damn zerg clan comes and abliterates the entire server with you being on of them so now you're and find a new server. Yeah it's pretty much rinse and repeat but I mean I guess it's fun if you like getting excessively angry and wanna murder everyone buuuuuut you have no loot and you just get spwn camped.all in all I would recommend this game if you're looking for something that will make you experience rage like nothing ever has before.,Rust

As well as giving the rust community more ways to make trap bases by incorporating electricity which is a great addition. Gameplay Pros Solo is hard but is able to be done. Recomended 3 man group. Any group with people 6+ will be set in their wipe in rust.Cons Clans in this game that are 8+ will dominate the server but is able to be tackled by offilining or allying with another group to take down a common enemy.Conclusion This game requires a lot of time to be played since you need to materials to build up your base and aquire new guns aswell as researching them which takes quite a bit of time to do. Being very good in pvp in this game is crucial and you will not get away with not being able to left click on poeple. Consider this game to be a 2nd job working 6 12 pm in a sense that if you dont spend enough time into the game you wont get anywhere. THE GAME IS GREAT !!!!!,Rust

It is a post apocalyptic survival PvP game that really tests your limits. Spawn on the beach get beaten down by naked people who swing their around to mock you. Esacape the evil circle and make it to the woods start gathering wood and basic supplies like mushrooms and hemp cloth. Craft yourself an hatchet and a pickaxe and start your resource gathering build a shack stash your make a bow and go PvP you're most probably going to die but if you make it congrats your hunt was succesful. Keep stashing your and make a decent base go loot in the closest rad townand find something of value run back to base in hopes of getting there unnoticed and stash your new (better) After many hours doing this you are going to be shocked how time consuming this game is and for what? Wake up next day do whatever you do when you wake up log in on steam eneter rust find your server. to spawn in with the text ""you got killed by _ZERG_KOREA_10_MAN_CLAN. now repeat.okay for real this game is amazing however if you have no friends that play this game it is going to be very difficult for you. So keep in mind that soloing in rust is for experienced players if even them. I with 3k hours can have a hard time soloing.

Steam sent bot automated message of refusal twice. I'm pretty sure it was bots anyway. I refuse to believe steams customer service is so bad that they'd refuse someone with one extra hour of play time.Anyway I'm somewhat glad they didn't because once i decided I was stuck with it. I tried to make it better and looked up some video's on how to improve fps in rust and I picked up a few tricks that I didn't know. The biggest of which being the ''Global.free'' command which I believe boosted my fps by about 40 50 and removed most of the stuttering. So now rust is fully playable for me. I guess I'm just making kind of a warning before you purchase make sure you have the specs to run it.

The community is if your computer is under ing $1 000 in value for some reason it won't run it at all and it is a to play. No matter what you do this game will you in some way. There is no benefit to playing this game! It is a great concept and I love games like this but this is poorly executed and new players are not welcomed by veterans at all. And 9/10 times when you log into this game you will be killed no matter what you have. Even if you literally only have a rock and a torch a roaming AK player with ing 4K monitor a sweat pool under his chair and his $400 gaming headset and $4000 gaming set up will pant over killing you over and over.

431648,2018-12-23,0,0,417,False,Recommended,I do reccommend this game since you will get plenty of play time out of it for the price but there are some things i'd like to add some reasons why i've started playing this game less and less lately. First the good. So the game is definitely worth the price which basically comes from the game's awesome building features and high anxiety combat. At all times in this game you have to be constantly alert and ready to fight because you have to fight for your hard earned loot and resources with other players. It's both good and bad super rewarding to win a fight/raid or completely devastating to lose it all (especially back to back). The other good parts of this game are the updates which are constantly being added with the most recent being electricity and water based updates involving boats and ships. These updates will keep things new and interesting and let you experiment and explore more new locations all the time. However I think there a few fundamental issues with the way the game runs as a whole basically involving balancing. Playing solo is very much possible in this game which is what i've done for nearly all the hours I have in game but it is the most frustrating way to play (on vanilla) since you are always outnumbered always outgunned almost always on the receiving end of a sneak attack/gank or always the target of raids since you can't afford the upkeep for a good base or don't have allies to defend while you're offline. This is essentially what burnt me out on this game restarting every few days or weeks because I was raided by a 2 man 3 man or entire clan. I have tried team play but it feels like a cheap and easy way out and i've always liked a challenging game instead of having everything handed to me. With a group it just feels like you can steamroll anyone in your region and it gets boring once you max out your upkeep and have every blueprint/gun and there isn't much else to do but kill people. It is a fun game overall but it just gets to the point where restarting over and over burns you out. If I come back it might be to try out the new updates but until then i've moved on to more singleplayer oriented survival games like 7 Days to Die or The Forest. I think part of this is my personal preference since I don't really like PVP in general but if you're someone who does and likes a tough skill based game this is for you 100%.,Rust
431649,2018-12-20,0,0,390,False,Recommended,NOT A GAME FOR THE FAINT OF HEART! Besides that is a great game yet VERY difficult and time consuming. The only real advise I can give is prepare to lose everything you worked for while you are offline. Friends are almost required for this one. Just hop on the steam forums and try your hardest to join someone so you can stand some sort of a chance.,Rust

431655,2014-02-23,0,0,1411,False,Not Recommended,I love Rust. I have been playing this game before it was even good. I have so many amazing memories on this game and nothing made me want to stop playing. But the devs. added a new function. The Decay system was added and its actually a really amazing idea it makes idle players bases decay away if they don't get on reducing lag. and it also made players/clans not able to create huge bases because the tax on your base is relative to the size of your base. This is a great idea and system but it doesn't clash well with the other systems in the game. finding blueprints making a base and getting components are WAYYYYY too much to do. This game doesn't feel like a game and it more feels like a JOB. It's actually frustrating because I have to get blueprints for stuff find the stuff to make the stuff I know. and then gather resources for the daily tax on my base. The devs either need to get rid of the decay system (which I don't personally want) or the blueprint system (which I do want). I don't enjoy this game as a solo I would LOVE it if the devs. changed this stuff. But I truly don't think they will and the grind feels like a JOB. Overall I love Rust but can't recommend it because it's just too much and the devs really need to make it feel more like a game and less like a JOB.Please read the big box of text before skipping by my review I have 1400+ hours. I am someone you can believe,Rust

431670,2019-01-02,0,0,1817,False,Recommended,Rust is a game for people that have a lot of time on their hands to complete tasks or to even grind to get guns to try to kill people with go on raids or upgrade your base. Unless you are good enough to kill geared people with low tier weapons then you have to work a lot. Playing solo isn't ideal because the amount of zergs or clans that may play on your server depending on the population gets very toxic if you keep dying to more populated groups. I would say playing solo is for after understanding the game. And if you're reading this and you just purchased the game keep in mind you're going to rage a lot because people that play this game are very skilled just know that once you get better it'll get easier. Anyway one last thing if you're planning on getting rust but are still unsure I can promise you hours of fun and if you get good you'll get even more fun out of it.,Rust

BUTTTT there's just 1 thing that I don't ING LIKE. New system okay u hear me right? Basically it used to just be BLUEPRINTS then XP (was wank) then components and then bps and components. Pretty much too much grind past 3 days pretty much played for I think 13 hours atleast and maybe me and my 2 mates are just WANK but best we got was a relover. And this was a 2x server with no kits btw. And it wasn't the python it was the wank one. So you need a ton of grind they add all these juicy guns in but you'll never get em unless u are 1 sweaty who doesn't care about pvp and just wants to hit barrels and open boxes all day long. ME. Listen I love the game I REALLY DO 700 plus hours but ME IN THE BALLS. On order of the peaky ing blinders I want the game too 1.BE LESS GRINDY +1And easier to get guns yes not too easy but damn man I remember back when I could actually make myself a p2 and not having to use a bow for 5hours until I get a wank relover. I went on a server today (never do this) to actually use a Ak and P2 etc just to feel the weight in my hands and even discovered new guns I had no clue were in the game. Btw I'm not a who cries when I lose gear so I'm not making the review for this u I just want it so I can get my hands on a P2 again or bolty maybe even ak YES DEFO BE HARDER TO GET THEM 2 but not 100 hours hard.

There are endless play styles that you can explore. I tend to be a bit of a pacifist so I try to make friends with my neighbors. If that's not your cup of tea you can go around the map squashing everything you see and take everything for yourself. The players tend to be a bit toxic but if you are not as quick on the draw and willing to give diplomancy a try you can make friendships you never knew could exist before.

Never relaly thought I had it in me to compete PVP but was really drawn to the crafting building side of the game. Purchased the game just before christmas and got into it. Initially had what seemed like lag issues but it all came down to a wireless keyboard. From then on quality gaming has ensured started as a solo a couple official servers. Was getting slaughtered left right and centre some people would pretend ""friendly player"" then kill you at a short distance (must like the look of my stone tools). Didnt really get any building done just kept getting hammered but Ak's or groups would butcher me. Found a modded server that is local and made a start. Into my second wipe have teammed up with a master builder it seems got the mainbase set on the second day and have just been making mild alterations as we proceed. Really enjoy the duo play have had a few engagements and wow check out the bow if you can hit the headshot Oh what a great feeling.

If you're up for a bit of a challenge and don't mind cocky and immature people this is the game for you! This game offers planning building shooting sneaking raiding and all that fun stuff. It is very unpredictable and offers a variety of servers with different rules and possiblities. Just look around and you'll find something that will suit your taste. Playing alone can be considered to be quite rough to say the least. If you're not a highly skilled player I'd advice you to bring some friends or at least search for some in the server chat or on Reddit.This game is very stressful not to mention frustrating and if you're not careful you may find yourself enraged by one tiny mistake made by either you or your teammates. Many of the players are as mentioned above on the toxic and immature side as this game can bring out the worst in people but if you're thick skinned enough you can take it. Putting this aside I absolutely love this game. It is very fun to play with my friends and I advice you to try it out.I'd rate this game 7/10 (it would be higher if the community wouldn't be so negative).,Rust

You get very good loot like guns extra mats and end game items for building.Building bases are very fun to do but I always get raided so the fun does come to an endbut you can always start again.It is very enjoyable with good friends as well you will learn off of eachother.I recommend this game as it is a challenge but rewards you with fun!9/10 Conkerp.s I only have 21 hours so far so I may not of excperienced the full content of the game just yet so my review may only surface the full excperience of the game but i still have many hours to play it.p.p.s This is only my opinon I may be wrong or somthing but this is what I think if you have any discrepencies please feel free to comment.,Rust

431886,2018-08-20,0,0,245,False,Recommended,Rust. What is there to say about rust that already hasn't been said? Rust is a Survival game set in what seems to be a post nuclear island that is filled with animals scientists and even other players. Players compete (or help eachother) to build up a base farm materials and eventually get great end game weapons before wipe day. Rust is a great game in my book and I love the style look feel and almost everything about the game. It always feels so great to take down The helicopter or get the chinoook crate. The PVP combat system is great giving many different weapons with many different advantages (or disadvantages depending on how you look at it) and giving each encounter to feel unique. To sum up rust is a great game and should be bought and played even for it's somewhat steep price. Love the game and almost everything about it.,Rust

431891,2015-09-04,0,0,483,False,Not Recommended,Look I edited my review before. Most of hours are from Legacy I won't lie I have ever so hated the new direction of this game. Sure albeit that in the begginning it was nice for a change since yeah Legacy looked like a piece of junk but at least it was functional if that. I no longer see a functioning game anymore when I look at this.Yeah the graphics improved but do they run even on my high end system? No.Yeah the map seeds were improved and generate more interesting maps sure but do people refrain from squading up in a clan and camping objectives for components? No. Yeah you could say that the gunplay has improved but is it smooth? Is the bullet drop realistic? Do people no longer roof camp and headpeek like I am playing Counter Strike when my bullets emerge from my characters mouth? No. Yeah they added boats hot air balloons helicopters hell even tanks but can we pilot them? Can we make Soviet Russia the clan we always desired? Can we fuel our engines with Vodka and praise our gracious leader Stalin? No. Can we have tracer battles at night like we are immitating lazer fire in Star Wars? Or is it pitch black and holding any source of light is basically a target for roof campers like I think it is. This game is no longer something I want to be a part of. I have always loved it yes and I come back just about every interesting update to see if they actually fixed FPS optimization and added actual content but despite their convincing fan base that this game has a somehow positive reputation status on reviews despite the price INCREASING for this piece of crap I see no end no improvement the ground mistakes that plagued it at the begginning have not been cured people still run this game on potato whether it be for FPS or for the fact it enables people to be better at PVP I don't know which is worse I feel like I enter Verdun whenever I come back nothing innovative about this game at all. I most definitely recommend to stay away. Despite my hundreds of hours of farming I do not enjoy this game. Period.,Rust

While I have noticed that the game has slight bugs the developers are very active and always patching them. Along with bug fixes new stuff is constantly being added into the game. In my time playing the game I have come to realise that a part of the Rust community is very toxic and most people just want to ruin your day. Of course I have also met multiple people who have helped me progress through the game and get started. Rust is sometimes about exploring and the developers have done an amazing job making the natural environment look amazing. I recommend this game to people who like PvP and PvE. While you can play this game by yourself I also recommend getting a few friends and playing together it is much more fun that way!,Rust

431947,2016-12-19,0,0,332,False,Not Recommended,My original review was during Early Access. I must say i'm disappointed. So i'm going to be changing this to a negative. Most achievements still don't work even on official unmodded servers(I'm not using an achievement unlocker. I shouldn't have to). Still a terrible online community. Playing solo is next to no fun. You have a higher odds of winning the Powerball than you do NOT getting griefed once you are killed.No option to play by yourself unless you find a completely empty server which due to my area is overseas so no thanks. If i wanted to lag i'd go back in time and use Dial Up with AOL.,Rust

(unless you are geared then they will kill you) &gt But this game is about killing other people and taking their loot. SO DONT COMPLAIN IF YOU DIE AND LOSE EVERTHING THAT IS HOW THE GAME WORKS! Anyways it takes time to find the non toxic people in this game and once you find them it makes this game a 10000000000x better I promise. People in this game will be glad to teach you how to play this game this game is easy and fun once you get the hang of it. *If you are clueless on what you are doing in this game and there is no one around to teach you how to play do yourself a favor and watch YOUTUBE it will make this game a 100000000000x better.* Anyways sorry if I wrote a lot I get carried away when I write but anyways I hope you understand what I said and I hope you have a great rest of your day! ),Rust

431954,2018-12-31,0,0,171,False,Recommended,The game is great. I enjoy survival games so my review might be a little biased. If you don't like PVP or survival games this is definitely not the game for you. However if you do I fully recommend this game. It has a survival system that isn't too ball breakingly hard but hard enough to where you notice it and tend to your needs. The PVP is sometimes stupid with people who camp on roofs people who just rush nakeds with AK 47s or just times when you shouldn't have died. But there are great points to PVP and that feeling you get when you get your revenge on some salty kids you just sh*t talked you. As far as PVE when going to Launch Site mind the tank. If you hear helicopter blades get inside. Don't try and kill scientists if you don't have the weapons to fight them. And boars bears and wolves are so easy to kill. The game isn't hard but you will have to put time into it. Before refunding it I recommend that you just get to know it. I assume if you put in enough time you'll learn to enjoy it.,Rust

I spent 15 on this game back when it came out and after playing it now for over 2400 hours I still play it quite often!It may have issues but for a game to be that cheap and have no ingame transactions other than minor cosmetics its a ing steal!One of my most played games of all time and even after all this time they keep updating it. Every thing from new events to minor loot changes even tho it is not as often as it used to be its still really consistent (first Thursday of every month).At times the devs of the game (FacePunch) can seem disconeccted from it's playerbase in terms of what direction the game is heading in.I have my frustrations wth the game but they do mainly come from me knowing how great the game could be and how great it has been and still is! After having played it for so long I really cant give it anything else then a 10/10 its one of my favorite games of all time but I still hope it gets better as it has it's flaws!

432019,2019-01-14,0,0,25,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. If you need a fullthrough review you may need to look for someone who spent thousands of hours in this game. If you'd expect me to go through those hours chances are it won't happen to a guy like me who enjoys a different view towards Sandbox games.Yes by definition this is a sandbox game. With the obvious generic elements of survival open world multiplayer stuff that does not hesitate to bring your first few minutes into terror comparable to your first circumcision. If by any means you are afraid of that happening towards you don't waste your money in this game.If you are willing to commit then welcome to the game that will repeatedly crush your hopes and dreams. I would compare this to Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress in terms of it's lack of mercy towards the players but that depends on which servers you'd land on the most part probably the community and official servers. If you obviously wanted to do things solo in this game then you may have to make your own server to do so.As many generic survival games follow you gather resources build your own base and commit to scavenging and developing to become one of if not the best man or woman in the server by having ""cutting edge"" late game hardware that will dispose anyone whether prepared or unprepared. And by no means creating a crossroads for all players whether they should commit against the unpredictability made by fellow players or toss the game to the bin and call it a day. If you are willing to commit then congratulations you are still far away from being an official masochist.Random events and NPCs generally happen and appear every tick of the clock adding to that already chaotic but vibrant mess that makes things more dangerous but as always taking the risks guarantees a reward alot worth than your grandmother's fake pairs of pearls she normally wears everyday and that's calling the chances of yourself getting something better like a rocket launcher or something worse like nothing. Including the players for that reward? The same variation who knows they might have something you need to satisfy your stats or something even better.But how did this game garnered such a mixed reputation despite a community's ""very positive"" review? It's a bit weird to say that the game lacks content but to put it more truthfully Rust have definitely rusted itself out pardon the pun.The players are the sole reason the game builted up it's well known standing reputation. Like things in life each individual would begin to prey over the other regardless of their intent. An unwanted achilles heel many games not wanted but nevertheless given by it's players. The unpredictability scale explodes by every player that joins in and that remarkable wanting journey to get everyone the experience they need is only defined by what other people hurl into them. Whether by a charming cuddle of friendship or by no means many's favorite approach a violent swing. The game does not lie about it's basic description and by tossing them phrases similar to that of survival isolation do whatever it takes to survive. Such oversight by players from the game's very truthful description left them doused with frustration and disappointment. But even if one were aware of the nature of this game there is no doubt about many people's answers that everything is the same with or without hardware.How the game runs is okay to say the least. It's one of the few Unity Engine games that doesn't seem to collapse the player's enjoyment in the game for most time but its notorious presence of breaking the game still persists for a few but growing numbers of players. Most would blame the community servers' contents others for reasons of the engine barely optimized or just inconsistent. The music is unneccessary and the sounds are okay as the annoying birds on the balcony. Unless Steam gets the option for players to vote between good and bad this is as far as I can go with this. If you think my review sucks you'd probably be right. But as how Rust goes it's not making it up there well to be relevant but as my experience goes it only works like charm with friends and I have to admit there's still a few more good things to do.",Rust

If you first start on a server the rust community is saltier then an ocean. They all dont care if you are new its still a kill to them. They have guns while you have a rock and then they call you bad and to leave because you dont have anything. So in conclusion DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU RAGE!! THE GAME IS VERY TOXIC and its quite hard too.,Rust

432037,2017-02-12,0,0,176,False,Recommended,Sorry but I have to change my review. This game is huge waste of time becouse of most toxic community I ever saw in open world multiplayer games. The game is so boring at begining becouse all you need is a luck to not meet anyone until you make a base and furnance. This seems easy but community on all servers I ever was seems to be 15 yo low IQ kids who just play to with others. You will get killed 99% you meet someone and it's pretty hard to not meet anyone on these maps. Developers are doing great job but they have to find a solution for this toxic community which is destroying not only gameplay but whole Rust game. Normal players are leaving servers and those kids who are reason of it will leave too becouse they have nobody to annoy after they leave. I wasted so much time just spawning running hiding getting killed and again and again It's like 80% of time in Rust you just trying to start. I'm speaking as a solo player. If you play in group of 2 or more people it's far more easy whole game is super easy when you play in group of 3.I thought getting killed by 3 fully geared guys on beach while me having anything is just a bad luck but more I play the more I realize this is not just bad luck this is normal and so much people doing it.I would play on server with intelligent hacker rather than with 40 toxic kids in big groups annoying weaker players.,Rust

432049,2017-12-07,0,0,923,False,Recommended,2017 This game has had so much content added to it since it first came out in Early Access back in 2013. The Legacy version of Rust which is the one that came out in 2013 was lots of fun. I really miss it and am sad to see it have to go. The new version of Rust which I guess isn't really new since it was released in 2015 has had so much content added to it. The Developers of the game do NOT dissapoint whatsoever. They are full of supprises!2019 This game is still one of my favorites. Since my last review it's had many updates and a ridiculous amount added to it. I highly recommend.,Rust
432050,2019-01-26,0,0,361,False,Recommended,Very fun as long as you intend on spending most of your time playing this game. Almost all servers with above 5 people reset every 1 2 weeks which I feel is unnecessary when there is a decay that destroys your base if you are inactive for a few days.

432095,2019-01-21,0,0,140,False,Recommended,This is a great game I truly love it but it does have some issues especially for new players.Gameplay wise the game is excellent. It's easy to start but hard to master. However the only way to play this game is online and most of the community is super toxic. The chances you'll come across a friendly player or even one that won't kos (kill on sight). A giant clan can just come and grief you even if you are a naked with a thatch base. Even if you have nothing but a rock you'll get murdered and laughed at by groups of geared players. They don't care about the loot on your body half the time they won't even check it they just want you dead.The graphics are great and really easy on the eyes. However the game runs like garbage if you don't have a NASA computer. Good luck getting this thing to run on even the best of laptops so you should snag this game only if you've got a good graphics card and ram. However it does run on crappy computers but at about 5 frames a second. There are graphical settings however the graphics really don't change the frame rate unless the setting are ultra high. So this game is great but you're gonna need a good computer to run it.This game's purchasable cosmetics are pretty interesting and cool. In games like counter strike and even the free to play zombie survival game Unturned the in game cosmetics are for weapons and clothing pieces. However in Rust the cosmetics still include Weapons/Tools and Clothing but it also has some cool additions that are unique to the game furniture and building supplies such as bedrolls furnaces and even doors. In my opinion it's a really neat concept for purchasable cosmetics and I look forward to new skins and even new items that can use skins.This game is updated consistently and they're pretty interesting. The major updates can change the way players strategize the game. New tactics can be added with the newest update as of this review electricity as you can now use electricity in traps and in a clan. I believe the game's updates really shape the way the game works and goes to show how commited FacePunch is to this game.In conclusion I believe everyone should at least try this game. It's a great game in my opinion and the people you can meet in this game while rare can be friendly and you can cooperatively work to make a giant base and even recruit more people to your up and coming clan. This game is holds a spot in my heart and I would give it a 9/10.,Rust

The servers that are there are supposedly moderated but there is no sign of it when you require assistance. The server i played on was PVE and went to PVP without notice. They also crapped up the rate of decay. In a matter of days my town decayed and i have to start all over again. The community is overall very bad. No one helps each other they just try to raid your house over and over again. It is not allowed on my server but guess what they take no action. Maybe with some dedicated servers and some sensible decay rates this game would be fun to play. Currently though i would stay away unless you like to waste time starting over every few days. Refund!As of late summer 2018 i got banned by the game developer. I was hacked and my account stolen. While they can clearly see my account was hacked and i was not the culprit the ban still holds. This is a scandalous way of doing business innocent until proven guilty clearly is something they have not heard of. Furthermore they have stained my name with this ban and this is against the law.

432195,2018-08-12,0,0,34,False,Recommended,"Rust makes better use of voice chat than any game I've ever played. You are naked and alone on the world's silliest island. There is no narrator or announcer so instead you submerge in the quietude of the unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet as you uselessly smash your rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you've also harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. If you're particularly industrious you'll have furnished a nice wooden shack a stone's throw away from some fresh water and reliable resources the entry level homestead necessary for any successful Rust campaign.successful Rust campaign.ADVERTISINGBut then you hear it. Faintly at first. Carried on the tip of the breeze. It's another idiot in Rust. I don't know what it is with this game. Maybe it's the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored maybe it's the brutal vastness of the design or maybe it's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance so when you're spotted by an idiot you'll start hearing the talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer they get louder and more confident and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults.It's so hilariously antagonistic that I wish I could say I didn't love it. I wish I could say that it didn't feel incredible when one of those naked idiots charged me with their rock and I switched to the battle axe I fashioned out of scrap metal (which he almost certainly didn't know I was carrying) and put him down with a single well placed strike. I wish I could tell you that as I was standing over his fatally wounded body that I didn't laugh my off when my headphones were filled with the voice of a prepubescent boy shouting ""Hey man wait a second!"" I wish I could say I didn't kill him anyway. No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust and I wish I didn't mean that as an endorsement.If it feels like we've been living with Rust for a long time that's because we kinda have. The game was first released in Early Access in late 2013 by developers Facepunch Studios and it's been a mainstay of goofy YouTube send ups ever since. If you're somehow unfamiliar with the premise think of Rust as a dumber more nihilistic Minecraft. You wake up on a map armed with only a rock and a torch. You quickly figure out that by banging your rock on a few environmental doodads you can harvest a few basic resources (stone wood and cloth) which you can parlay into a few prehistoric instruments like a spear or a hatchet. This is similar to the scrounging mechanics in plenty of other survival games but what makes Rust different is how deep that tech tree goes. Eventually from those same basic ingredients and a few mechanical leaps of faith (like work benches and furnaces) you'll be able to craft pistols flamethrowers and rocket launchers. Rust famously does not quarter off its servers to keep entry level nakeds away from the roving troops suited up in advanced firearms which means that occasionally your journey will end with you matching another player's revolver with a rock that you've tied to a stick.This is the heart of Rust. Wake up naked run for your life do horrible things to one another. There is no grander narrative or mythos or win condition. Most of the servers are on a strict weekly or monthly reset schedule which scrubs the island of any lingering housing or fortifications left behind by the players which gives the experience a strange sense of futility. Yes you will need to manage your hunger thirst and health and as you ratchet up the tech tree you will discover increasingly effective ways to stay alive but that's it. Sure there are some areas on the map that are stricken with radiation which leads to the implication that perhaps you and the rest of your misanthropes are occupying a far flung post collapse society but those moments feel more like window dressing than anything else.I spent the vast majority of my time in Rust playing solo but I don't want to discount the notorious community of players that band together in clans and wage wars of aggression along the shared hunting grounds. One of the fascinating kernels of Rust's brutality is how everything in the world remains persistent even if you're logged off which means that smart players arm their bases with land mines punji sticks and keypad locks while they're away. (Some clans even recruit players across all time zones to make sure there's always someone on guard.) That's a coordination I appreciated from a distance. There are a number of YouTube documentarians showing off the multi man raids that spawn from committed Discord channels all over the world. Instead I engaged with the population of Rust on a purely incidental level. An extremely geared man takes pity on you and drops a crossbow at your quivering feet. That's Rust! A kid and I are raiding an abandoned gas station for food and weapons and I give him the extra pair of pants I was carrying around. When I'm turned the other direction he bashes his rock right through my skull and runs off with the rest of my stuff. That is also Rust.Given the tone it shouldn't be surprising that the community I found in Rust tended to be fairly juvenile and toxic. There's a high concentration of racism and misogyny in the global chat so much so that I eventually left the channel entirely. And unsurprisingly the new player experience is quite prickly. The development team didn't spend any time cooking up a tutorial (which makes some sense when you consider how long the game has been available). Instead when you join one of the many servers you're presented with a few faint hints in the top left corner of the screen ""harvest wood!"" ""build a hatchet!"" The crafting system itself is fairly intuitive with well written tooltips for each of the items in the catalog and you can fast track yourself into some serious munitions if you get lucky with a few resource spawns. The PvP combat won't win any awards but it's tactile and packed with wonderfully sadist bone crunching sound effects connecting your hatchet with an idiot's head feels great and really that's all I needed. There is also a strange post release monetization model in which you can buy ugly paint jobs for your weapons and clothing. Rust is fascinating for a hundred different reasons but Counter Strike style weed leaf AWPs isn't one of them. Still though I think everyone should at least have a taste of Rust. It's hard to think of many other games that are this uncompromising in its worldview and I'm utterly entranced with how little faith it has in our ability to get along. We could build a utopia on this island! We could cast aside our weapons and construct a peaceful commune where everyone is fed warm and loved. I love how Facepunch dangles that potential in front of our face with no real incentive pushing us in any direction. If we are to dehumanize ourselves and turn this Eden into a battlefield we will do it on our own terms. In Rust there is a real sense of complicitness when you eventually succumb to violence more potent than in any other survival game on the market. Despite the lack of rankings to chase or K/D to nurture or exclusive vendors to unlock despite the unassailable fact that none of this will matter as soon as the server is wiped we are at war and we always will be.",Rust

432199,2019-01-29,0,0,1228,False,Recommended,Rust rust rust this game has taken so many of my hours enjoyed most of it. I got this game on humble bundle back in 2016 and have played it on and off with my friend group. The first time I played it me and my friend enjoyed our saturday hunting people down with spears and running around killing people while they scream in voice chat enjoy your first few hours it will never be like that again. Now after another 1.1k hours me and my 4 man group run around on r/RedditMain US and typically get aks and do lots of raids. This is very time consuming though so we only actually try to have a fantastic wipe on 4 day weekends because we are all very busy with life. This game will require you to sacrifice lots of time to enjoy it fully. My experience playing solo it is very difficult and lots of clans will on you no matter where you live. You will enjoy playing solo if you build somewhere away from the main monuments and in the snow you will truly experience the survival aspect of freezing to death because you jumped in a river or being killed by a wolf/scientist with an inventory of sulfur. The game is much more difficult playing solo but if you build away from people you will likely meet other solo players who are friendly with you. Also if you are new people can tell and there will be people who help noobs there will also be people who run around without mics on and killing everyone they see. If you run up to someone and ask how to play they likely will take you under there wing that's what I do when I meet another player. You will experience the full enjoyment of rust the first time you get online raided yes it seems like it sucks but it will be the biggest adrenaline rush you have. The counter raiders the rockets the loot everywhere. I have been doing online raids as well and they are very enjoyable but you likely will not get any loot. Final two things you will be offline raided no matter what and probably will lose your stuff if you off a big group/clan most people do hate clans though but stay on the move and you will move bases more than once. Wiping the server seems dumb unless you play the game I could not imagine a wipeless rust the wipes allow you to all be placed on the same playing field. Overall I love this game and will remember it for a long time I recommend this game the ups and downs are insane you will hate it but love it. It is hard to explain unless you get it. But you should get it. 10/10 worth the price.,Rust

The development roadmap on the facepunch website is great. I've already logged plenty of hours in gmod as well which has the same developer.The only negatives that could possibly come from this game come from cancerous servers where progress is nearly impossible. Low pop. modded servers are the way to go. I've even had friendly interactions and alliances on these servers. I suppose once you have some Rust under your belt the high pop. servers are good for a frustrating challenge. Buy this game bring friends.,Rust

At the start it was really fun to play with my friend and when there was a server contest for 20 50 eur we would always win.. Those times were really fun for me and i was addicted to the game. When our favourite server got shut down i took a 3 month break and came back to the game being full of useless updates that don't make the game fun for me at all.. All you do in this game is start with a rock get some wood make a base and then just quit because the game has all these updates that make you grind and be good at the game..Never liked the grinding part of games because i always thought games were meant to be fun. To be honest early access felt like a completed game and in a lot of parts wasn't even broken. All i have to say those 600 hours were the best and the most fun in rust i have had and now that i know i wont ever get 1k hours on this game makes me sad and it's all because of the updates with scientists boats tree minigames that don't work most of the time puzzles. I hope i would be able to go back to 2017 when i started to play the game and had some good fun. Go watch facless's most recent videos on how rust really is meant to be played and you will understand why the community and everything else has ruined the game and how new people usually just refund the game after 30 minutes just because they get killed by an who runs around with a semi rifle near where the nakeds spawn and just kills them over and over just because someone did it to them.. I have only had 1 time i've saw a cheater so i think it's not really infested with them... (subscribe to facless if you already haven't) bye. never playing this game again until they remove the show of updates or make it easier to play.,Rust

432344,2019-01-30,0,0,6,False,Recommended,Rust is a very time consuming game to finally get started in. If you want (in my opinion) go into crowded servers when you learn the basics of this game. The game is a overall good and fun game. BUT has a serious problem with little kids running servers and helping there friends and also a moder problem. But if you can get away from that then you can have a fun time. Just remember going solo in the game is very difficult. There are alot of teams in this game that can ruin your day. Even though I have 2.9 hours on record This is a solid game. I would reccommend this to a person who love a challenge and survival games.,Rust
432345,2017-09-15,0,0,1416,False,Recommended,This game can be a lot of fun if you can find a server that fits your playstyle and the amount of time you can commit. There are plenty of modded servers that offer a completely different feel compared to vanilla. I play solo a few hours a week and still enjoy the game on a monthly non bp wipe solo server.Fixes Any BP (blueprint) you can find inside a barrel/crate they need to make default. Why do I have to find a BP for a bear rug or guitar? A solo player has to learn a BP for each item he wants to craft but a group of 5+ players only needs one player to learn it to be able to craft them so groups have a huge advantage over solos. Groups should be forced to research an item or be penalized by the item breaking faster during use. Since they added BP's to the game there is basically NEVER BP wipes on official servers which seems to defeat the purpose of adding them.,Rust

432372,2019-01-23,0,0,66,False,Recommended,This game is very fun although quite toxic. It is a good experience that is quite unique. Although it s also one of those games where you almost need to commit to at least a couple days of your life. That is if you want to have a chance of survival. When you start you will be a nice normal human being. Just after a couple hours you will become a toxic person. As you will be building your base and be so proud. Then inevitably will be blown shy high once you decide that you committed enough time for the day. You will go to sleep and once you wake up you will be upset. You will wake up to your body on the starting shore. You will run back to your base to find they destroyed your sleeping bag and cabinet. And it happened like the middle of the night so everything you put time into is gone. You will sit there and back out of the game for a day. You will restart and this process will continue over and over until you are the top of the food chain causing trauma to other players. But yeah It s a good game.,Rust

432376,2014-08-16,0,0,1732,False,Recommended,Rust. Its always Rust. Still love this game after all the years. Blood sweat and tears Over 1850 hours over two accounts and I'm still trash. Doesnt run so well on my pc. I honnestly reccommend this game to all those out there. So many different ways to play this game it suits just about everyone. Dont like grinding? you can play modded. like fighting? play battlefield servers. dont like fighting? weirdo. So many options to choose from.I remember when i first bought this game i was still in high school and it was just before the summer holiday i spent everyday playing Rust through the summer ( it was legacy back then) and it quickly rose to my most played game and has held the position since. Many childhood memories have been replaced by memories from rust. Its amazing how i can remember so many different wipes from over the years. Ive run shops traps zergs roleplaying bases and i even was an admin and a chat moderator. I have met so many people and made friends from all countries this game has given me so much and unlike other games this game has been so cheap. ( Rainbow Six and Overwatch in particular) I probably have spent under 35 on this game over all the years and hours ive spent. Whereas ive likely spent around 100 on each overwatch and rainbow six.Anyway try this game. Its provided me with something to do for 6(ish) years.Thankyou Facepunch for unlimited hours of fun for me and my friends. You have put so much effort into this game and we all appreciate it.,Rust
432377,2019-02-02,0,0,14,False,Recommended,"This game is actually amazing. I know I'm not a ""Veteran"" of Rust like a lot of other people with thousands of hours but I don't need that much time to be able to tell how good this game is. I know I don't have much playtime yet but I have played 14.5 hrs in 3 days. I know what you're thinking I don't have a life. That is only PARTLY true I still have school and homework and friends and family and I am going into high school so that just goes to show that I took time out of my busy day to play this. It can be a little toxic sometimes but there are still lots of nice people if you just look. Overall this game is worth it. To be honest it is worth sixty dollars or more and I wish there was a deluxe edition or something because I would have bought it. Also if you want good Rust gameplay because you're still unsure about whether to buy it or not check out the youtuber Welyn founder of the Pumpkin Gang! Also check out Enardo he's great too!

432403,2017-11-05,0,0,889,False,Recommended,I have played Rust for 6 months total now and have about 900 hours and this is my review based on my experience.WARNING This game is HARD! Note before buying you will die lots. The graphics at maximum are stunning though the game is poorly optimised despite what the developers say as of now. To run it this way at a solid framerate you will need a top end PC. Otherwise you will most likely have to turn down the settings.The audio quality is pristine and the stereo and surround sound is accurate and has a wide variety of settings for different audio configurations. Footsteps are easy to hear which improves gameplay also.The game mechanics are some of the grindiest I've seen although if you have 10 hours a day spare for the game it is worth it. The building is easy to pick up on the gunplay is skill based with recoil patterns and no RNG and the crafting system is simple however the blueprints and workbenches can be a pain to farm for especially for solo players.The community is full of extremely toxic teenagers although there are a few good apples out there. If you can get past that then it is an enjoyable experience.,Rust

Videos online will guide you to how build those bases both small and large but reality is that it won't matter. You will wake up and the place will be raided or someone from a clan sees you and they will raid you within seconds (presumably you can fix walls but you won't make it in 2s to do anything wood or stone doesn't matter). On videos it says it takes more time to go through rock or steel but in reality groups of people can blow whatever you have there within seconds it isn't expensive for them at all even if raiding is not worth they will do it just for the gig. So it definetely caters to grouped players and it will be hard to learn anything as a solo. Disregard those solo videos on youtube to get to that level you will grow gray hair and will have to play like the game is your y spouse not a game to have fun in ) There's more to add but basically....I can't recommend it just because the idea is nice graphics are good and feel of the game itself is attractive the gameplay is pure cancer for a player that plays solo and even if it is more than 5h a day not to mention some casual person....just don't waste time and money.If you would want to start fresh well all of what I said plus other irritations and the fact that you will be up against groups of people and solo people who are much more experienced and will just die endlessly and spawn all over the place for other player amusement. To get to those levels of experience or finding someone you can trust to play with headache that will drain you until you won't even want to play the game itself.If I would need to give marks to the game Graphics 8/10Music 9/10Environment 8/10 (although small maps even those that say are big).Price 3/10 (should be someting like 9.99GBP not much content (comparing to A titles) and it is still ongoing project (as i understand...).Fun 4/10 (it is fun for 2 3 days have 15h of play time since I bought it) But eventually it is more a niusanse than something you want to play on regular basis.So resume is that although I did mentioned to my friends about the game but definetely would not recommend to spend this much money (at least to some) on a product that's just basically mocks you instead of delivering proper value for it's worth.,Rust

Even if you have pretty much nothing people will just wait outside your door and kill you. It s kinda wild actually. If I want to wait inside my house for hours on end until it s safe.... oh wait I do that already as I m in Canada and it s currently about 33C everyday.....Not really sure how they can fix this for a solo experience... even after a server wipe it seems like groups can get high end gear in the first day... tough to compete with that.****EDIT****I bought this game a long long time ago and it was great.Now....the optimization is terrible.

The vanilla servers are pretty sweet the game is much slower and next to impossible without friends to help you as there are loads of teams working together that will shred your very existence at the drop of a hat.There are loads of modded servers as well that imo are where its at.. A good 5x server with a couple buddies can result in some seriously fun PVP raiding base building etc. The survival side of things is very cool. 100% surviving from other players.. Alliances can be made sure but trust no one in any survival game. Not even your best of friends should be 100% trusted. Lock up everything you want to keep.Graphics are great music is sparse but always nice to hear audio is pretty solid. Voice comms are a little wonky but they are obviously trying to make it proximity to feel more realistic. Buy lots of RAM and an 8gb GPU minimum or you'll regret it ),Rust

Rust is a game that takes hours out of your day and it keeps you think on whether or not you're getting raided all day. You will go to sleep thinking about all the hours you put in and how u hope nobody offlines you. But you will probably wake up to being raided. And then you will have to restart all over again and keep going. This is the trust on rust and this is what goes through the average player's mind. And this is why i love it. It keeps me on edge and it's really competitive. The community is what creates the game without all the toxicity and KOS rust wouldn't be rust. And that's why i love/hate it in it's moments.,Rust

But at the same time this game also provides you a platform to be more creative and fun at the same time. You can troll people with your unique trap base get all their loots for free which I bet was the most fun part of this game. If you like survival mode games crafting PVP ing with others and play in multiplayer in the open world then this is your game. Is it hurt when other people killed and raided you? Yes but you can do the same thing to them since this is the idea of this game. I've experienced a couple of my friends who are rage quitting after getting killed by others so be prepared ),Rust

432554,2018-01-01,59,2239,90,True,Recommended,"It's hard to overstate what a magnificent exploration and adventure game Subnautica is.What really stands out to me is that experience not an XP bar but the accumulation of knowledge about the game world its locations and its inhabitants is the most powerful weapon in a player's arsenal.Take Stalkers for example They're the first large predators a player will meet and initially they're annoying and seem quite threatening. An experienced player will ignore them though or at most circle and poke them with a knife to make them go away while at the same time stealing all of their scrap. It helps to have upgraded swim fins upgraded O2 and other advantages but if you took upgraded fins and O2 tanks away from experienced players they still wouldn't have any issues with Stalkers.There's a lot to find and a lot to do in this game. The need to unravel the game's central mysteries and to obtain blueprint fragments salvage and rare materials from wrecks grottoes and strange installations will force you to leave your comfort zone time and again. First you'll crawl out of the Safe Shallows then you'll creep further and deeper then you'll swim further still until one day you'll be amazed at how far away from Lifepod 5 you've gone at the readout on your depth meter and you'll wonder how you ever thought that the seaweed areas just outside of the Safe Shallows were in any way scary.Sustenance is a challenge at first and you'll scramble to get enough food and water but later on they become a matter of management and planning ahead. If you're going on a long expedition you'll want enough supplies to last for the duration but not so many that you can't haul a goodly amount of salvage back to base.As for fiddly stuff you can spend hours building and customizing your underwater habitat customize the look and module loadout of the various vehicles you can build (once you've got the complete blueprints and necessary materials) and have a lot of fun with the wide array of gadgets and Portal/Half Life style ""techno guns"" the game has to offer. There's a lot of meat there but the true meal lies in exploration.Even at the very end of the game though armed with all the technology you've spent hours pulling out of wrecks and scanning (typically while watching your O2 meter like a hawk and listening nervously to that angry predator thrashing around outside) you'll never feel completely safe or at ease. There are great dangers lying in wait and you'd better hope you spot them on your sonar before their sonar catches wind of you....",Subnautica
432555,2015-04-16,71,1253,726,True,Recommended,I used to be a SCUBA diver. Can't do it anymore. There are days when I miss it all so bad it hurts. The freedom. The solitude. The Unknown... It's all out there hidden beneath the waves. Subnautica is the game I have been waiting for. In a strange way it feeds the sea hunger inside me somehow. Can't quite explain this sensation without having it sound corny and contrived but that's how it works for me.I stumbled onto Subnautica purely by chance while browsing YouTube gaming clips. Ever seen that *one* game that stops you dead in your tracks? I did. Definitely got my attention as I recall. It was an Early Access release so I could expect all kinds of unforeseen digital weirdness happening inside the game itself. My PC's operating specs were a tad on the light side too but it didn't matter. I wanted that game. Badly.I bought it. I played it. I built things and survived. I enjoyed every minute that I spent 'underwater' again. It's an alien ocean on an alien world. Curiously the sights and sounds around you might seem strangely familiar in spite of the bizarre shapes Life has taken in this place. There is indescribable beauty to be found here side by side with terrible dangers that are either innocently disguised or glaringly obvious. It takes a certain mindset to fully appreciate this world as well as considerable restraint to avoid blindly lashing out at every shadow that flits past your facemask. Remember. YOU are the intruder down there. Take a deep breath and immerse yourself completely. Welcome to Subnautica.,Subnautica
432556,2018-07-23,20,532,60,False,Recommended,To anyone reading this This game is best played COMPLETELY BLIND. Don't watch Let's plays don't read the Subnautica wiki. Just start the game.Game? No. Start your journey.This is hands down the best survival game I've ever played.It's also the only survival game that is not just about collecting ressources and building bases. It has more story &amp lore than all other survival games combined.It's story doesn't begin at the end of the game. It's story starts when you load up the game. It's your story. Not the base building keeps you playing but the exploration and the story drives you further.Drives you deeper.Literally.You push deeper and deeper. And everytime you reach a new area you don't feel welcome. Until you explore the area overcome the obstacles &amp problems there. You have to find out what wants to kill you. From your comfort zone into the wild. You make the unknown your new home. You were afraid first. Now you know what to do.You gather new ressources. They allow you to push even deeper.Rince repeat.You're not welcome.Again.I haven't had this feeling in any other game so far. Pushing into the open not knowing what will happen. Not knowing what to expect.My story playthrough took me 50 hours. I had goosebumps way over 50 times. The atmosphere the whole world the animals you meet. It's a stunning world and you're just a small part of it.No lethal weapons. You're on your own. You're weak. A lone survivor on a strange planet. Then you overcome the challenges build vehicles. Survive adapt overcome.This game is absolutely unique and worth every penny.No this game definitely should not be multiplayer. I am glad it has only singleplayer. You are alone. You feel alone.And when you finally find out the planet's secrets... you will know.,Subnautica
432557,2018-10-04,0,0,87,False,Recommended,Subnautica is by far the best survival game I have ever played! This game is unlike any survival game. You gather resources and discover technologies to build better and stronger equipment. As you play the game you start to get infected by an alien bacteria. Soon you will find yourself looking for a cure and by doing so you are discovering the misteries of this ocean planet.The visuals are amazing! I couldn't run the game at high settings cuz I only have a gtx1050 but still... WOW! The biomes look spooky and misterious. It just creates this spooky atmosphere.The music is also outstanding! Every biome has its own music. Play with headphones and you will forget about the real world.Then there are the creatures... O man the creatures!The sound design of the creatures is amazing! Just the sound of a reaper in the distance is enough to make me turn around. Not even talking about the gohst leviathan.I strongly recommend EVERYBODY to play this game!Hopefully I haven't spoiled to much about this game!Sorry for bad English.

432560,2018-06-11,0,0,64,False,Recommended,Subnautica is quite an experience. I've always been a fan of survival building games and this game can be considered a masterclass in the genre. Everything is very well polished and beautifully designed I have very few gripes about the game. The underwater landscapes are breathtaking and the design of creatures is very inspired. Building the sub known as the cyclops is going to be a gaming moment I never forget. The sheer size the cool factor of the inner workings watching the engine rev up. Such a satisfying progression I'm having a hard time comparing it to any other games.The only negative thing I can think of is that collision detection for entities and walls is not the best at times. I lost a fully upgraded mini sub because it feel into the ground and I could not retrieve it. I would recommend saving often because of a lack of auto save you can just quit and reload if any game breaking bugs happen.Overall subnautica is firmly in my top 5 favourite games. And I will be voting for subnautica GOTY 2018.9.5/10,Subnautica

432562,2018-08-25,0,0,229,False,Recommended,Subnautica...one of the best games I've played in awhile. Great story game play mechanics and graphics. The devs will not be adding any additional content to this because they are now underway with working on a new stand alone game of Subnautica but will continue to work on bug fixes for the game.You receive a lot of information early on to help point you in the right direction to progress as you explore but what's great for me was you still had to take that information and figure out a lot of what had to be done to futher insure your survival in the game.You start out with just some basic items and have to figure out how gain the things needed to create better equipment to survive and explore farther and deeper.....and deeper you can go.The great varity of Biomes and aquatic life is fantastic and the many different things that can and need to be explored creates a great atmosphere of beauty fun stress and fear.Subnautic does not support MP which for me isn't an issue but for those that this might hold back from trying the game I would say they would be missing out on a great experience.If you've thought about trying it but are still on the fence I highly recommend it and say get it.Just an update....Vote Subnautic for STEAM GOTY...I did and it should be.,Subnautica

I absolutely recommend it but be prepared to go on an amazing adventure.This game is immersive and atmospheric absolute beauty matched with moments of terror and humor and a well paced storyline with clues and subplots that lead you into the depths of the game yet let you explore at your own pace. The sounds and music greatly enhance the experience and are a major factor of the game pay attention to the sounds around you! The crafting system is very well done unlocking more levels and enhancements with different areas and just exactly when you need them. Base and vehicle building is also quite well thought out and customization is easy including turning your submarine into a mobile base if you like. Difficulty is also customizable anywhere from permadeath to creative (building without the story). However I would suggest not doing either as your first playthrough. Also as others have said DO NOT watch videos or read guides in your first time through this game. You want to experience it as it was meant to be and you will not get those ""firsts"" back even though it is still very enjoyable to replay (as shown by my hours played). In the end you will find you have been on a wonderful journey engaging your emotions and mind. Do not be surprised to find yourself emotional at the end. It is a compliment to how well the devs have crafted and paced the story and experience. DO watch through the credits at the end though for Alterra's (and the devs) final joke to the player!",Subnautica
432565,2018-03-15,0,0,59,False,Recommended,Subnautica was a game I initially thought seemed pretty basic at first but it still looked fun. So I had just gotten a decent gaming PC and I see it's on sale. I thought that I might as well give it a try and i'd refund it if I didn't. As soon as I started playing I was hooked I never thought something like this would be so appealing as I would explore new biomes and discover new sealife. The feeling of building your first Seamoth and exploring th deeper parts of the game had me so struck with a sense of acheivement. One thing that I never could have expected from the game is how genuinely terrified I was at times like when I heard a Crabsquid for the first time or when I first discovered what lurks in the dead zone. The graphics are beautiful with a unique style to every creature biome and flora.I have never recommended a game more10/10 would die by Crashfish againEdit Now we just wait for Below Zero,Subnautica

432577,2018-01-27,0,0,63,False,Recommended,I've played this game for a long time in early access. At first it was rough. Not much to do little to create and it lagged something aweful. However from the first iteration of this game to the official launch it has continued to improve and adapt. The lag is still there but very rarely does it affect play there is much more to create and explore and the story has blossomed into a very interesting tale of survival on a beautiful alien world. I am glad this game popped up in my recommendations way back when. As someone who doesn't enjoy survival titles all that much I love this one. 10/10,Subnautica

432582,2018-10-28,12,305,54,False,Recommended,"One of the best games I ever played.First words that comes to my mind are ""deep immersion"". Developers created a huge beautiful and very realistic world. Subnautica is mainly focused on exploration and it is extremely good. In fact I think that there are no enemies in this game at least I could not perceive any creature as enemy. They are not monsters but just local fauna that live their life in fact they are not even aliens they are at home and you were not invited. There is only one alien on whole planet and this alien is you. Once you learn behaviour of animals you will very rarely encounter any aggression. If for some reason you want to fight... well you may find a prey but bloodshed is absolutely senseless and unnecessary.Game is quite peaceful but it does not mean that there are no dangers in ocean. Pressure lack of oxygen cramped caves limited light... deeper and deeper you went more and more awe you feel. When your submarine hangs over the abyss and you can see nothing but endless cliff and depth... it is scary... well I hardly can remember another game that gave me such intense emotions.World in Subnautica is opened for exploration from the very start you can travel... well everywhere. Still amount of accessable locations is cleverly limited by available technologies. You can try to explore deep caves immediately after planetfall but without supply of oxygen you will just drown. So game softly push player to explore safe shallows first.There is storyline and in my opinion it is very good. I do not want to spoil anything just want to say that storyline is simple but intense yet not intrusive in same time. Bit by bit you will visit all locations and learn all mysteries. Final scene gave me very complex and positive emotions it is beautiful and full of hope with light sadness. It was worth all long way down.Gameplay can be divided into two stages. During first stage you salvage technologies gather resources and craft equipment. There is some grind but I can not say it is boring or tedious... you just explore surroundings and study local life gathering useful items by the way. And second stage is travelling when you gathered enough resources and crafted basic vehicle Seamoth you can explore almost everywhere. There are only three vehicles in game not too much but they are widely customisable. You can install different modules extra armor torpedo launchers defensive electric field and so on also it is available to change appearance of vehicle such as colour and finally you can even give your vehicle a name.You can construct your base that will serve as center of operations. Constructing is simple and effective it is very easy to learn and comfortable to use. There are lot of different modules you can combine and create your awesome station. Even more importantly game offers a lot of different furniture and decorations to customise your base and turn it to... well not just ""a base"" but your home. I really got attached to my tiny but comfortable underwater apartments and my tamed cuddlefish. I really hope that my pets will survive without me... wait it is just a game... *sigh*.Of course I must mention the stunning beauty of Subnautica. Blazing sunsets dense kelp forests impenetrable darkness with sparkles of luminescente flora and fauna... almost every scene literally craves for screenshot. As for sounds and music they are excellent such quality is really impressive. For example I humbly advise you to search for ""Tropical Eden"" melody it creates amazing magical atmosphere I was truly enchanted with.Game is not perfect there are some bugs. Several times I seen fish swimming in my base. Once during exploration of Aurora wreck I got stuck in textures and then suddenly fell out of the world. Well... all this tiny confusing troubles seems insignificant for me.Probably the best advice I can give do not watch videos and do not read guides. Explore by yourself! Believe me pleasure from discovering new things is worth the time. If you love adventure games with main focus on exploration Subnautica is a sure bet. Honestly I do not know any games that can compete with Subnautica in this niche. You do not want to miss this game.",Subnautica

432590,2017-11-27,0,0,124,True,Recommended,I was hesitant at first about buying this game but after seeing a Let's Play about this I just had to play it (thank you Mark).If you love survival games with a decent crafting system and an interesting story I highly recommend this one.The Story might not be complete yet (at the time of this review) however the game is about to leave Early Access soon.The crafting system is accessed through different machines ingame the first one of which is inside the escape pod that helped you survive the crash. If you want to build a new one elsewhere you have to gather materials first to build a tool that let's you build underwater bases and build a fabricator inside of it. These bases can be build almost anywhere in the huge play area which consists of several different underwater biomes. There are also several underwater vehicles you can craft to explore the ocean (somewhat) safely ) .Also it should be noticed that while this game is not classified as a horror game it can be quite terrifying to be alone in the dark ocean hearing all those strange different noises from all the different alien ocean lifeforms around you and then suddenly a bigger one of them roars right into your ears .A Coop mode was planned for this game from the beginning but the developers decided to focus on the game itself in single player completely and add multiplayer later (probably some time after the full release) so if you want to play this with a friend(s) you'll have to wait a little longer. Otherwise you can enjoy the game as it is right now.The developers stated that this game will not have a multiplayer mode. However they might develop a game in the same style in the future with a coop option Have fun D,Subnautica

432592,2018-11-22,0,0,62,False,Recommended,I picked up Subnautica from the Humble Freedom Bundle in February 2017. As the game was still in early access I put the game into my backlog list to play when it would be complete.The Good the Bad and the Middle GroundGoodStory the story of Planet 4546B is intriguing. There is just enough lore laying around to make the story of the world enjoyable. Exploring the exploration is top notch and is well paced. Areas/depths are soft locked behind the mod tech level of your submersibles you can push deeper if you want.Atmosphere the atmosphere of the ocean is excellent with each biome having a unique feel.Building building bases around the world is easy and enjoyable except for the high resource cost of some stuff.The Subs both the Seamoth and Cyclops are fun to pilot around. I would have liked the Cyclops or a third larger sub to be a bit more equipped for exploration.Flora and Fauna the plants and creatures of the world are interesting. I would have liked to see a bit more variety in their behaviours. Middle GroundSurvival depending on the game mode you choose you ll get a different experience with having to deal with the survival mechanics. I found the standard survival mode to be a little bit too much of a grind and tied to resource management for my tastes.Docking you can only dock either the Seamoth or the Prawn Suit in the Cyclops not both. In addition I would have liked to have been able to dock the Cyclops to the bases I built. This option would have been especially useful if you could connect the base and the Cyclops s power grid and life support together. BadResource Grind in the standard survival mode I found the grind for resources and the management of your life support to be a bit much. This could have been helped if you had auto collectors that could have been built.Limited Fast Travel in the late game you gain access to a gate network that can take you to some of the biomes. I would have liked a fast travel option that is tied to the bases you built and is accessible much earlier. Leviathan s Tails the tail section of the two late game leviathans you encounter are very similar.Bio mechanicals the Warper is the only bio mechanical creature you ll come across. I d have liked to have seen others and possibly some creatures that were transformed as a result of the Precursor labs. PlaytimeMy leisurely playtime to escape Planet 4546B is about 62 hours.RecommendationThis is a must own if you re into survival exploration atmospheric or base building games. If you don t like survival mechanics or much of a grind I d encourage you to go with either freedom or creative mode. Thank you Unknown Worlds Entertainment for creating a great exploration game with a great atmosphere.,Subnautica

The big risk big reward system is amazing and you're constantly running into new biomes full of horrific monsters that will make you say "" that!"".

Fun game the building part is fun resource hunting can be tedious enemies can be infuriating (more so since the latest updates added the ""teleporting claw your eyeballs out nope"" and the ""gigantic omg it shoots fireballs at your face nope"".) Placement of some of the tech items is absurd but with practice and a monstrous amount of planning and patience they can be obtained. True the game has gotten substantially harder over updates but for the atmosphere gameplay and especially the graphics I can still honestly recommend this title. I would however suggest tying to grab it on a sale though.Edit 1 Ok so since the addition of new content I cannot praise the game enough. The way the story has been implemented into the survival mechanics has really polished the game. The biomes have been smoothed out and look fantastic the sense of dread passed 500 meters compounded with the atmospheric sounds had me at pucker factor 9000 all the time.

432607,2015-12-26,114,766,217,True,Recommended,Everyone talks about how it's early access bugs blah blah blah. If you're reading this review you know about all that. I recently realized I am a huge fan of survival sandbox games and I have played quite a few in the last months. Here is my personal impression of this one.Graphics are incredible. I know everyone has said this but it needs repeating. On the lowest settings it still looks awesome! Some clipping and such but it never really bothered me much.It's very fluid (no pun intended) to get into it. I agree with most other reviews that recommend no using guides and such and just jump into the deep water (pun intended) and learn to swim on your own. It's a very friendly interface that gives just enough explanation to make you feel like you can do it on your own but not enough to make it boring.Edit I forgot the most important part (to me at least.) The metabolism for food in this game is very nice. In plenty of other games like this you have to eat every two minutes or face death from starvation. In this game keeping hydrated is the issue. While this is rather ironic while being surrounded by water it makes a lot more sense. I get away with eating once every day or two depending on my activity. Dehydration keeps me drinking daily but not constantly. Considering dehydration kills you faster than starvation I feel this is the most realistic representation I have seen in one of these games thus far. Here is what any new player needs to know Expect it will hurt you until you prove to yourself that it can't. Explore. Even the dark and scary areas. They usually have the best loot.Storage cubes cannot be used indoors (as of the writing of this review.)Predators are everywhere and you are not one of them. If it can eat you it will.If it can eat you it's usually in a scary area.You WILL get snuck up on and jumpscared. Give it at least an hour before you start looking up stuff online and once you do do it very sparingly. Discovery is an awesome feature to this game and the more you have to figure out the more valuable this game will be.,Subnautica
432608,2018-11-19,0,0,76,False,Recommended,Played this game quite a few times and to be honest I play with cheats sometimes because the animals scare me. On a different note The game does it's job at immersing you into the story you aren't playing the main character because you ARE the main character. Their silence is your voice and that is something not alot of games can do. Something that impressed me was the fact that this game brings out your instincts as if you are in REAL mortal danger for me there was alot of looking over my shoulder both ingame and real life.

432617,2016-02-18,42,708,399,False,Recommended,After 41 hours I feel like I'm ready to say my piece about this game. It's important to specify that I'm playing in survival mode where you have to constantly worry about food and water. The game will be very different depending on which mode you play because in the sandbox mode you can freely build and explore without ever having to stop what you're doing to gather nourishment. In hardcore you have to be extra careful because once you die you have to start over. At this point I'm glad I did not pick hardcore because there are ways you can die that just aren't forseeable. There also occasional bug in the game which results in your death like the all too common diving reel malfunctions.First Impressions This game is amazing. That can be and is said about many games. But there is nothing like Subnautica. I had been waiting for 19 years ever since playing the crap out of the incredibly immersive fun but ultimately flawed Sub Culture. Finally we have a game that surpasses Sub Culture in every aspect except the storyline. With that said Subnautica has flaws.The Bad In all it's glory there are a few nags some of which make the game increasingly difficult as you get further into the game. First I'm going to get it out of the way that there is a startup bug that made me almost request a refund even before getting into the game. Subnautica doesn't always start because the game menu screen frequently refuses to fully load. This is probably some sort of GPU initialization issue that prevents the graphics from displaying properly. In any event I have to exit out of the game and restart it in Window mode to get the game to finish loading at all.Also The learning curve is very steep. There are no instructions for anything and the information given on any device in the crafting menus tell you nothing worthwhile about what stuff does. There are some basic descriptions but they're very poor. For example the current generator says it generates current. When I started playing I had no idea what I would want to create a current for.The third thing is the max depth of the in game vehicles. There is much debate about the actual depth of the game. Some say it goes on forever. Others have quoted that the game crashes out at 60 000 meters. Some have said 20 000 meters. Others have said there is a secret world in the greatest depths which sounds pretty epic. In any event. The ocean goes deeper than I feel comfortable thinking about. The problem here lies in the fact that the vehicles seem to have a max depth of 200 meters. (I've since found the Cyclops can go to approximately 900 meters at the expense of power efficiency. I believe the Seamoth can also go to a comparable depth.)Fourth the hunger and thirst meters drop far too quickly. This seems nitpicky when you consider I did pick the survival mode but the problem with this system is that you have to spend hunger and thirst to find food that becomes increasily more difficult to find as the game goes on. As a result you might find yourself spending almost half your time gathering food and supplies to make water. Which leads me to the next problem in the game.Fifth scarcity of food and supplies for making water. At first everything is plentiful and readily available. Salt while a challenge to find when you don't know what you're looking for seems to respawn readily and limitlessly. Coral while seemingly limitless at first begins to disappear rapidly after many hours of gameplay. Moreover I have seen no indication that it respawns. Food which pretty much comes from the natural fish stocks can disappear amazingly fast from an area. After 41 hours of gaming I have effectively cleared all of the initial shallows of the ocean plus the surrounding depths of fish. It's amazing how fast they diminish. The only solution seems to be to put respawning or faster reproduction of the fish in the game. I have not seen any indication that the fish respawn at all which seems clear by some of the dead zones I have in my current save. There are some pretty heated debates about this in the discussion groups. Naysayers claim the supplies are unlimited and all you have to do is look further. My answer to that is that you begin to spend a lot more thirst and food meter energy and other resources to find food. Because of this there is a rapidly diminishing return on the value of food and water in the game. The devs claim it causes people to explore more. I'm not satisfied with that response because the reality is this if people have no motivation to explore. If they just stick to the shallows and eat and drink they aren't going to have the attention span to stick with the game for the long term anyway. Apparently a fix is being tested in the experimental mode but it's coming all too slow to a stable build.Sixth and my final gripe and this is definitely as glaring as the fifth scarcity of resources. Copper Quartz Acid Mushrooms are plentiful at first but become ridiculously difficult to come by as the game goes on. Quartz is practically used in everything because you need it for glass and rubber which you need for building and making Power Cells to power your vehicles. Each Power Cell takes a vast amount of resources which would not be as much of a problem if they didn't deplete so rapidly. Even with the power efficiency mod only a small expedition can use 6 power cells and leave you scrambling for resources. Many users have defaulted to the same argument they have given to the food shortage problem that there's plenty in the depths. The problem is that it takes more and more energy food and water to farm this stuff. You end up trapped in a cycle of more and more rapidly diminishing marginal utility on all of your resources. This really needs to be fixed or users will basically be driven out of their own game by scarcity. Both of the last two problems have people vehemently defending the current scarcity with the argument that resources are scarce in real life. I would like to point out however that one person alone in a wilderness does not leave vast expanses of land void of any life. Certainly these rich biomes should be able to support just one person. Also if the player were able to hunt for shellfish and crustaceans in the game diversity of foods might help lower depletion rates. The player should be able to find oysters and dig for clams. The Good Based on my criticisms some might get the idea that I don't like the game. That couldn't be more wrong. Subnautica is hands down simply the best underwater game ever made. There's no competition. The environment is rich full of wonder and among the most immersive games I've ever played. The world is packed full of fascinating creatures beautiful vegetation and unparalleled undersea effects. The graphics are complimented by some of the most incredible sound you could possibly imagine. All of it adds up to a game that makes you feel like you're living rather than playing.It's one of those games that comes along and really changes things forever at least among those who have played it. In my opinion the game hasn't gotten nearly the recognition it deserves. The amount of stuff you can do in this game and the painstaking attention to detail are mindblowing. Those are things I hope never change with Subnautica. Many early access games are dumbed down in later iterations. Unknown Worlds Entertainment seems to have a good attitude about adding new features instead of taking them out like some other developers of early access releases have done in the past. I just hope they maintain the trend.Subnautica is an oustanding game worth its price about three times over. It comes with my highest recommendation. In it's current state I would give Subnautica a 9/10.Added 11/23/17 The game has been hugely updated since this review.,Subnautica
432618,2016-08-02,0,0,165,True,Recommended,Definately a game to blow some time on if you just feel like derping around. Yes it does get boring after a while but you can find ways to make it interesting like make a garden collect eggs and raise 100 stalkers go to the dunes or aurora and crap your pants by being attacked by reapers shock the reapers and make them cry build a huge base for no reason build an island with the terraformer or explore. In my opinnion Id say this game is horror and adventure its horrifying when you get eaten alive by a reaper or watch a crabsquid or crabsnake wander around (crabsnakes being a bit more majestic than a 14 legged freak). The game might not have alot of potential just yet but things like (im not saying the name of the race) alien bases and alien abominations are definately going to spice this game up.Yes the monthly updates might not be the most exciting but quite a few add interesting concepts like the chargers those definately allow you to save a few resources by charging your depleted cells and batteries where before these were added you would have to craft new ones. Summary an interesting game with a lot of possible potential not reccommended if you easily stress out because some creatures will latch on to you/grab you to kill you (i think i set the record for the number of yous in a single sentence) because like me i feel like im going to have a heart attack recommended if you do like changing your pants alot and feel like building some crazy base.,Subnautica

It is one of the best survival games I have ever played and will go down in history as one. I may spoil some stuff in this review so please play this game it is so much better to experience all of this first hand. Anyway without further ado let us get into the review.The PositivesThere is so much that this game gets right that it is hard to sum up in a quick review. The visuals are stunning beautiful water effects the world feels so alive. The sound design is immaculate from the reefbacks to the squids they all sound spot on. The content is amazing with all locations in the map distinct and offering something completely new. The creativity and customization regarding your base locations are unique to any other survival game I have ever played. The equipment is weak but effective not making all the monsters seem powerless and still posing a threat to the player.The NegativesThere is honestly not much to say. One point I could bring up is how difficult it is to find parts and blueprints for equipment. Through my game I had to result in searching up where to find particular parts because it was taking me so long to find just one part. Another point to possibly bring up is the lack in developer updates. To my knowledge Unknown Worlds is currently working on a new expansion but besides that they haven't really added anything to the game.In conclusion I really enjoyed this game and would recommend it to anyone. This gets a 10/10 for me. A truly perfect survival experience.,Subnautica

432642,2018-11-21,0,0,21,False,Recommended,DISCLAIMER This review has been created for the autumn sale badge primarily. Its content is valid nontheless.I've only got some 20 something hours under my belt but I've been following and (back then only occasionally) playing Subnautica since its early stages of early access.First things first the developer did in fact deliver on the promises they made. The game has been in development for quite a while and the full release is a breathtaking piece o' art in my opinion. The environment(s) are captured beautifully as f* k. The world that you're exploring screams for you to keep going further since it seems there's always something new right around the coral (I'll never forget my first time discovering the glowing mushroom caves!).One thing for the single players among you Subnautica is single player only and it's unexpectedly great at it. It may be a survival game with all the classic survival elements (that to many screams for multi player) but it is well thought out and does in fact have a story that you're playing through.The game mechanics are pretty straightforward. A decluttered UI and easy controls add to the great accessibility of the game. The only actual issue I find myself having is that sometimes objects are being rendered quite late and thus popping up out of nowhere. Might be that's due to a rather short detail drawing distance/LOD stuff? Dunno... I can only speak for myself of course but I can live with that pretty well.The best part though that made me grin all over my face (warning contains spoilers for new players) Getting ripped apart by a reaper leviathan for the first time gave me massive chills. The same uneasy gut feeling you have when you wake from a nightmare. That alone is an example of fantastic staging and scripting. It's rather rare that a game can make you feel like that nowadays without the use of jump scares or the likes.TL DR Subnautica is an aesthetically more than pleasing game within a world full of surprises and a load to see. The story is in fact rather interesting the more you get into it.,Subnautica
432643,2016-11-24,0,0,97,False,Recommended,Not since Morrowind has a game captivated me so with its setting and ecosystem. It does justice to the oversaturated survival crafting subgenre and shines as an example on how to do Early Access well. Equally beautiful and terrifying Subnautica will have your full attention as you explore the mysteries surrounding this alien waterworld.Edit Unlike other games the increase in price has matched the content added. It is still completely worth it.,Subnautica
432644,2016-11-23,0,0,94,True,Recommended,Probably the best run early access I've played pretty frequent updates with loads of new content. The game is engaging and a background story unfolds naturally as you explore new biomes unlock new technologies and stumble on hidden locations. Can be taxing on lower end systems because the graphics are beautiful and the sea is full of life.,Subnautica
432645,2018-07-07,0,0,87,False,Recommended,This game instilled me with a sense of awe that no other game has matched. Chock full of gorgeous underwater scenery exploration is a balanced by the sheer unadulterated terror of the alien unknown. With a masterfully crafted soundscape Subnautica will leave you on the edge of your seat for the entire experience. My only regret is that I can never play it for the first time again (but this hasn't stopped me from replaying it anyway).,Subnautica
432646,2018-07-07,0,0,213,False,Recommended,I have played plenty of games in my time but this is by far the best. It has such a sense of eploration and a magical and mysterious aura around it. You can survive you can explore you can learn and you can build. I highly recommend it. But the thing I love the most is going deep. Down there is so much different to the surface. Monstorous creatures beautiful sights and scary places. Im going to be honest some siduations can be terrifing. And at times I have sworn its more of a horrer game. I love this game 9999999/10.,Subnautica

432652,2015-02-07,0,0,79,False,Recommended,Being that this is an early access game i cant say its 100% at this point in time (Im not meaning completed Im meaning as a score)For its current state though it is quite amazing and graphically eye catching with its bright mix of colour.Pretty much a ocean survival game not much else to it.You swim around collecting resources so you can gradually build (and name) your own submarine known as the CyclopsOnce you have that the vast oceans of this alien world are yours to explore.. on saying that though there really isnt much to do at this point.. I guess you could go explore the depths in your mini sub (the Seamoth which can also dock inside your Cyclops) and avoid the many sea creatures that are able to attack you (there is also many that are neutral) but there really isnt much to do and after a few hours of gameplay it may get a bit boring for some.Personally i love it.. Its good to play an ocean exploring submarine game rather then the usual FPS or any other mainstream game out there.Yes theres bugs and glitches and some can be quite annoying but the console commands assist alot though.In all if your willing to assist the dev's in progressing this game and love exploring alien ocean depths then yeh i recomend this game.If you wanting more content and greater activities then i guess its best you wait this one out for a while.*Update* Just buy it!

432664,2018-11-11,0,0,98,False,Recommended,Despite having quite the fear of deep ocean I find myself inexplicably drawn to the simplicity of the mechanics in this game as well as the complexity of what you can make it. The crafting is flawless and is easy to understand and leaves room for you to build whatever kind of base you want. The exploration is excellent as each new area has multitudes of creatures hostile or passive alike and many resources and hidden secrets that make this game a fantastic all around experience that captures the beauty of this foreign ocean planet as well as the ferocity and fear of the unknown that lies in store. If you're looking for a game that is immersive and exciting as well as fear inducing and awe inspiring do yourself a favor and buy this game and experience all of this for yourself.,Subnautica

432667,2016-06-16,0,0,478,True,Recommended,Don't let the early access scare you away. To me there was enough of a game here to be worth more than the 20 dollarsI can say right now the best aspect about this game is the exploration aspect. This has to be the best representation of an explorable ocean in any game I've seen. Its an alien ocean too. Its huge scary deep and full of things that want to murder you. Oh yeah that's the neat thing. The ocean can get REALLY deep. Try looking down while wading water and not being able to see the bottom until you go very far down. It can be terrifying.There is a huge variety of ocean biomes to explore with colorful (or dull depending on what biome you're in) flora and fauna in them ranging from underground caverns with pink jellyfish mushrooms wastelandic dunes coral reefs kelp forests and crashed remnants of the ship you fell down from and more.As someone who's terrified of open water this game was a really cool experience. The deep water and alien life really captures the vastness of the ocean and the scary unknown things that dwell in it.,Subnautica

After the full game came out a while ago it took me weeks to beat it. I remember everytime their was a big update to the game I would have to restart the whole game. I did taht untill just a while ago when (again) the full game came out. This has been one of 3 things that kept me playing Steam. This was my very first story mode game. To the Creators of Unknown Worlds I would like to thank you for being the reason for staying on Steam. I have had so much fun times on here. I would also like to congratulate you on this game. This game is just like a baby and I am a person growing up with it. I have watched this game go from being just a small little game with low graphics develop over time get bigger more well known to being a full game with awesome graphics good detail awesome voice actors unique story plot and of course badass music. I love this game so much I was willing to spend $160 on a better graphics card (I think it was) just to play this game. The weird part is I hate the ocean in real life but I was willing to play this game to help me overcome that fear. It didn't really help. So I would recomend this game to anyone who is afriad of the ocean and wants to scare themselfs. Again Unknown Worlds I would like to thank you and congratulate you on this awesome game. P.S. I will spend any amount of money to get the DLC next year.,Subnautica

But this is a lot more than good it's awesome. The story starts off simple which is good. I like Commando. Arnie killing lots of people. Simple is good. It's really great fun scavenging and learning the tech tree at first to break you in. I was expecting the game to then peter out after a couple of hours but it just didn't. It got more and more engaging and had me absolutely hooked. The story structure and attention to detail is fantastic. I was lucky enough to play this in VR on the Vive and although the detailed graphics are boarderline fuzzy/horrible (trying to see your inventory panel) the immersion reminded me of when I did my PADI licence and it really made me feel like I was tootling about underwater. I started holding my breath when I was running out of air for heaven's sake! Anyway...buy this please especially if you have a Vive. Next to Arizona Sunshine this is one of those VR defining titles for me and made me glad I paid for it the whole VR thing.

My hope is that they don't lose interest too soon and patch it up in order to move on like so many other titles.Around once a month a new patch hits the stable build that changes things so much that players are persuaded to start a new game. And I don't mind a bit! Each new build repairs critical bugs adds new content and improves upon elements that were already interesting enough to inspire players to imagine even more ideas for the direction of the game.The true energy for growth in this title comes from a masterfully orchestrated suggestion function/bug reporter combined with a development blog that reports to players exactly the progress that participant Devs are making towards implementation of said improvements. This system for development does wonders to stem the inevitable tide of criticism that comes from players that typically feel disconnected from the process.Game is worth it in its current state $11.99 summer sale.

432701,2018-11-27,0,0,124,False,Recommended,"TL DRWith a personal rating of ""S "" Subnautica brilliantly blends the abysmal possibilities of deep space ocean life into a survival game about the exciting yet menacing exploration of the unknown.Basic info.Genre Action Adventure (Survival) AdventureTheme Sci fi Aliens UnderwaterPlayer type Single playerPerspective First personSummarySubnautica follows the story of a spacecraft s crash on the hostile underwater world of the uncharted Planet 4546B in the late 22nd century. Specifically it follows the struggles of one of the survivors who descends into the ocean exploring and learning about the alien environment and its habitants in order to gather resources craft items and maybe find a way home.Main analysis Overall score 91 100 Rating S Story15 15Universe Outstanding Subnautica takes place in the fictional Planet 4546B which is almost completely covered in water. Aurora crash landed on the planet luckily on a guyot (namely the Crater) that houses a variety of miniature ecosystems. Each of these biomes contains its distinctive set of flora and fauna to discover and resources to harvest. More specifically ranging from the busy coral reefs of the Safe Shallows to the deadly red and white forests of the Blood Kelp Zones and from the hypnotizing Jellyshroom Cave to the blazing Lava Lakes the Crater s biomes are diverse unforgettably original and awe inspiring. In addition being an outstanding base building game Subnautica allows the creation of compartmentalized habitats progressively flourishing into true palaces. Eventually the protagonist may also explore Aurora s crash site and other abandoned bases and facilities.Characters Impressive Despite the plethora of data downloads that can be found among the wrecks the protagonist doesn t encounter any other survivors which results in an even more horrifying atmosphere. The player is forced to explore the ocean as well as encouraged to seek companion among the native fauna (or flora). From a biological perspective Subnautica s biodiversity is impressive and its lifeforms are carefully designed to reflect their evolutionary adaptions. Planet 4546B is a breathing and breathtaking world where one can witness the organisms complex relationships as they develop.Plot Intriguing The game s multidimensional narrative unravels in accordance with the player s pace of exploring as it takes place in a non linear open world environment filled with wonders and threats to discover. The main story line has a classic 3 act structure (setup confrontation resolution) and it includes several side stories. Spoilers aside discovering the history of Planet 4546B is truly fascinating and intriguing. Notably the player is equipped with a PDA a multipurpose device which among others contains a data bank aimed at documenting their journey s logs.Artistic work18 20Graphics / Visuals Captivating Planet 4546B s beauty is colorful vibrant and vivid the wild biomes are refreshing and visually stunning even the intruding technological advancements grace upon this aquatic paradise.Cinematics Bad Subnautica s cut scenes are disappointingly few short and seamlessly integrated into the gameplay.Soundtrack Enchanting Being an established sci fi themed title Subnautica s futuristic soundtrack contains songs that eerily etch the mystery and the horror of the unknown and of what lurks within it the curiosity of exploration and the thrill of discovery deep into one s soul. During their staying on Planet 4546B the player is accompanied by electronic music that stimulates the feelings of loneliness and homesickness yet strengthens and replenishes their hope and will for survival.Audio Great The game s audio successfully vitalizes its creatures rendering them acoustically identifiable as well as either cuter or more horrifying. All in all it contributes to the ambience by creating the ultimate subaquatic experience.Voice acting Great Despite the lack of NPCs the player may collect voice logs and come across radio messages which include immersive performances. On the other hand the player is always accompanied by the voice of his trustful PDA s AI (and occasionally the ones of his vehicles AIs). Finally the telepathic contact with the Sea Emperor Leviathan is mesmerizing.Gameplay12 15Modes Good There are 4 modes (Survival Freedom Hardcore Creative) with different restrictions on gameplay. They define the requirements for survival (as far as the player s needs are concerned) and the number of available lives.Extras Great Duration Extremely long Replayability Incredible Difficulty Not adjustable Grindy The game has a standard level of difficulty (depending on the chosen mode) and requires hours of farming for resources. The player is advised to read the PDA s guides and tutorials.Technical work17 20Mechanics Hooking In order to survive the player must keep their health above 0 while covering their basic needs for oxygen food &amp water by any means necessary. In the meantime they re called to avoid radiation and extreme temperatures as well as defend themselves against any dangerous life forms. The quest for survival is fortunately facilitated by a complex crafting system that provides the player with cutting edge equipment tools vehicles Seabases etc. Furthermore base building feels addictive as it involves the full customization of interiors.Controls OK The limiting 5 slotted toolbar in combination with the lack of hotkeys for essential items (such as the Scanner and the Seaglide) forces the player to periodically spam the PDA in order to access unbound items in the storage and perform basic functions (heal eat drink etc) which is inconvenient and frustrating especially when it s a matter of life and death. Sooner or later the player gets used to driving the game s vehicles and can navigate their way around with ease but till then there s plenty of bumping to put up with.Functionality Good Having spent 3+ years in Steam s Early Access Subnautica is almost bug free. There are occurrences of glitching AI now and then (e.g. models harmlessly passing through the player s base) but since the game s release I haven t encountered any game breaking bugs.Menu Options File size Reasonably big Misc.10 10Development Great Community Great Personal experience19 20Version 3.0.0.",Subnautica

Incredible atmosphere great game design and progression system. Intensely engrossing. Overall fairly solid with no crashes although there is the occasional bit of frame dropping when I enter a vehicle or breach the surface of the water.The only thing that makes me stop playing is the sudden realization that I've gone wayyyyy past my bedtime and I'm starving for some real life food. There's very few games that ever do that to me and very few things in life that do that to me as well. Subnautica is like a gripping novel you just can't put down or a suspenseful movie you just can't turn away from but it's also an epic journey and the more you play it the more you WANT to play it.So yes it has a good story. It also has good gameplay. In some ways it borrows from games like Metroid in that you MUST upgrade your gear in order to reach certain places like reinforcing your submersible so that it can descend further. But it also blends that with games like Amnesia where the needed blueprints are in a *really scary hulking wreckage thru a hole that your sub won't fit thru so you better get to swimming...* It's got ATMOSPHERE! LOADS OF IT!And all of the little tidbits of audio from the Alterra Corp. AI that talk to you through your helmet audio paint a little bit of wry humour just to break the scariness a bit and the game loop of going back and forth between the bright safety of your undersea base and some truly terrifying and inky depths just keeps you from getting used to how scary AND beautiful Subnautica is. There are some truly gorgeous things to be seen in this game and the handcrafted locations feel like just that HANDCRAFTED AND UNIQUE and NOT copypasted and bland!In terms of lethal weapons you have your survival knife and you can manufacture nerve gas torpedoes. The former is more of a tool though you can use it to fend off smaller parasites and nibblers and secure food and the latter is reasonably effective against anything that isn't Leviathan class. You're neither at the bottom of the food chain nor the apex predator but when you have to craft your own torpedoes you probably won't feel inclined to fire them for any other reason besides self preservation. All the aggressive species are inedible and provide no usable materials so your best bet is to avoid them as much as possible. Besides even if you kill one the sea has a limitless supply of them.But in terms of other gadgets and tools the Stasis Gun is going to be the one that gets you out of a pinch the most because it works on almost everything and it's the best tool for securing food AND for holding the most unsettling creatures in place while you either swim the hell away or get a scan and then swim the hell away.And all the crafting and customization of your undersea habitat feels really well thought out. You don't *have* to go and make a big aquarium and populate it with creature eggs gathered from the depths but after you come back from a terrifying dive after being chased by giant spooky beasts you are going to think about sprucing up the place while your terror subsides and you can work up the courage to go back there because you left early because you ran out of food or storage space because the spooky place had all this great loot back there.C'MON WHAT MORE DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN?!?!

I never played the beta I never saw anyone else play it. I just saw it on sale bought it because it looked good and started to play it blind. I stopped playing for a couple of months because I did not know what else to do. I started playing it again because I saw some gameplay and wanted to play it again. In the past week and a half I built my first base seamoth prawn suit seaglide and cyclops because I did a lot of googling. I spent most of the game swimming around without any of that stuff and dying a lot. So what I ask the developers is to put in more objective descriptions for the people who have never heard of this game before or is new to these types of games.

If you've ever wanted to play a survival game but always dreaded the greving this is the game for you.

432737,2018-03-23,0,0,52,False,Recommended,Product received for free. A masterpiece. This game is incredible a real experience. It has stirred emotion in me unlike any game has done in a long time.What Subnautica does is truly unique. Subnautica stands you on an alien ocean planet. It dares you to survive and tricks you with its illusions of safey. Truly the best advice I can give to any new player (which I recieved myself) is to play this game guideless. Dive in with both feet and survive. Figure it out on your own. Leave the guides and tips till later and let the game teach you.But aside from all of this the thing that Subnautica does the best is this Subnautica gives players the means to build the perfect ocean base and research facility. It seduces you with its habitat customizations posters cuddly toys (and fish) potted plants and furniture. It does this so well that you'll forget you were even planning to leave.And that's what makes the final step in this game so much harder. This game excels at creating an emotional bond between player and experience and then forces you to say a heartfelt 'Goodbye!' and leave it all behind for home.So goodbye for now Planet 4546B.I'll be coming back to do it all again in future.

432743,2018-02-02,0,0,28,False,Recommended,"Let me just start off by saying this game is easily one of my favourite games ever made and easily the best survival game on steam The visuals and the sounds are top notch they set up the atmosphere spectacularly and really immerse you in this beautiful world. Every biome every cave cavern and whatever else you come across feels and looks incredible and unique.My one gripe with the visuals is that there are some poppup issues the game engine seems to have a hard time with that but the quality of said visuals easily makes up for it. Exploration is easily one of the best parts of this game. Terror mixed with bliss as you go deeper and deeper into the depths of planet 4546B fills your every nervous breath as you watch your oxygen tank slowly deplete while simultaneously listening in a boot shaking fashion to the sea monsters roaring and swimming around you. I swear sometimes this game is a horror game in disguise.Subnautica being a survival exploration game you wouldn't expect much if any story. Subnautica once agains exceeds your expectations by delivering an incredibly well linked together and presented story. The deeper you get into the game the more the story and the lore of this planet reveals itself to you through readable PDAs exploration and astonishingly good voice acting. You slowly start making sense of the rubble steadily uncovering every secret this planet has. ""Why did the Aurora crash?"" or ""Why is that bizzare creature even for this alien planet so hell bent on killing me?"" or ""What happened to all the Aurora survivors?"" you get answers to all of them.There is a whole spectrum of different fauna and flora for you to discover and learn about some harmless others scaring the sh*t out of you to the point where you wish their whole species went extinct. At no point in this game do you ever get lethal weaponry which really helps with the whole setting of you never being the apex predator the ocean is your apex predator.Something I stole from someone elses review but is cool nonetheless ""There is a sense of wonder and danger present in this game that I haven't found in other similar titles. The light fades the deeper you go and sometimes all you can see is a limited field in front of you. That doesn't mean you don't hear everything. ""The devs of Subnauta are unbelievably devoted to this game. Subnautica was released on early access 3 years ago. Back then it was more of an idea than a functional game. The graphics looked like crap and the game was very underdevelopped. On multiple occasions the devs almost went bankprunt but luckily for them the game was brought to light by youtubers and twitch streamers who helped foster a community for the game and helped the game prosper. After funding for the game started getting some traction the dev team went beast mode and started pumping out update after update and made the development progress easily accessible to anyone through the trello where they released logs and images of the whole thing. Thank you Unknown Worlds Entraintenment ( hehe studio name matches the game ) for making this game a reality.

But beware of replayablility 8/10Played the game start to finish in about 32.5 Hours but sandbox mode seems like the way to go. I finished the game in about 2 weeks of off and on gameplay using a few wiki pages to find some of the fragments for the tools and find quicker ways into the lost river/lava zones. If you went through the game completly blind not having watched anyone play the game or use wiki pages (I did both) it would easily take you another 20ish hours to finish the story AND you would have a ton of fun in sandbox exploring all the different areas of the game.

432756,2018-08-08,0,0,66,False,Recommended,Subnautica is potentially the best survival horror game I've ever played that's not even labeled as a horror game. You start off the game as a survivor from a ship called the Aurora and your primary goal is obviously survival. You constantly have to keep an eye on your food and water meter (unless you're not playing survival mode) alongside your oxygen and health. And if that's not enough to keep you on your fins soon you find out there's fish so big you never want to see them more than once. Subnautica also has a very interesting story that I will not spoil here for those who haven't played the game yet.So now that the basics are out of the way let's review the positives and negatives about the game PROS A huge oceanic environment with many different biomes to explore all containing different fauna and flora. A touching story that will make you sympathetic towards a massive aquatic species. Three interesting vehicles that are mostly fun to operate and integral to your survival. Dozens of different blueprints scattered around the biomes leading to useful equipment. Potential fish friends! Contains the most terrifying area in any game ever (also known as Crater's Edge).CONS Is a bit buggy at times. It can also be a bit laggy.Overall? 9.8/10! Subnautica is probably one of the best games I have played in a while and I'll be looking forward to the Arctic biome DLC.,Subnautica
432757,2017-09-02,0,0,320,True,Recommended,This game is early access but it is AMAZING!I love The Immersion! It really sucks you in. The Graphics and detail are great! Salvaging Crafting Building Exploring Surviving BluePrints with risk for reward mechanic That moment where your computer A.I. talks and puts you at ease with its calm voice just to get jump scared a moment later by some random aquatic creature because you think your actually are struggling to survive!I truly expect this game to be my favorite game for a long time. Even though its not finished it is only an update or two away from being a complete story.I do however want the bugs fixed. Especially immersion killing ones. I notice everything especially the difference between a normal battery and an upgraded one in the charger having the same mesh. My cyclops not healing all the way once when I patched the hull (Related to being hit by a Ghost L********). Jumping on my cyclops with my prawn sends it 138 000m down into nowhare through all the terrain and still hearing the ai screaming about it being below crush depth. Causes me to reload my last save. Lastly the performance on some areas causing the game to stall for a bit while it thinks not rendering items occasionally fast enough and all performance hit items related to this should be addressed. This will only add to the games value and for me that oh so great immersion.I fully expect the team to fix these things and have a well polished game in the end. They are completely open about development to the public and have a trello page that you can follow to see exactly what is going on right this moment in its progression.I give it a 8 / 10 now and feel it will be a 10 / 10 game by the end of its developement.IMO this game is a must have! I say get it.

Expecting 100s more hours to be played.I ran into a very frustrating issue where the game doesn't load properly turns out the loading screen just super sucks. While the game appears to freeze it's really just a poorly implemented loading screen. Check your graphics card update your settings so that the game immediately picks the best your computer has to offer and be patient.Otherwise amazing game.

432761,2015-06-27,0,0,55,True,Recommended,I have bought a few indie games recently and most of them weren't great to be honest but this game is absolutely amazing! It's the best game I have bought for a while and here are a few resons why.Surprisingly it doesn't need a monster of a PC to run. I have a 1.8 ghz processor 6 gigs ram and ATI Radeon 5400 graphics card and it runs ok on minimum graphics.It's unique. Doesn't need much explanation it's an underwater survival game pretty nice.Lots of content you can build underwater bases submarines and much more in a brilliant crafting system.Overall I highly recommend this game well worth 15!,Subnautica

432763,2018-11-25,0,0,32,False,Recommended,"Subnautica is one of the best games I've ever played I can't recommend it enough.Normally the tags ""Survival"" ""Open World"" ""Exploration"" and ""Crafting"" turn me away immediately because I've spent so much time in Minecraft and these kinds of games are a dime a dozen. Subnautica is absolutely anything but. Immersion is a term used a lot in games but Subnautica pulled me underwater and into the game so well. The environment is beautiful the sound design is extremely well done and the story is... something I hope you get to experience without any spoilers. I was entirely blind sided by the moments this game brought about. Story is difficult in an open world because you might just miss some content but the developers made a system that led you to everything you need to.The survival aspect of the game is fun as well. As I said I've played a lot of Minecraft and other survival games so the genre feels very grindy to me now. This game's world drew me in to ignore any gripes with that and... made me actually want to have a base for the sake of living in the world. Living and furthering my exploration of the world below of course.I've played games since I was a kid so a lot of the magic of video games is a bit lost on me now but Subnautica caught me off guard and brought that magic back. It's easily in my top 10 games I've ever played maybe even top 5. If you're debating on playing this game please give it a shot!",Subnautica

432774,2018-03-19,0,0,177,False,Recommended,"""This ecological biome matches 7 of the 9 preconditions for stimulating terror in humans."" This game is terrific and at times terrifying it can also be heartwrenching. It is more than survival but it is survival at it's most basic. I won't give spoilers aside from saying it's a horrific shame to be here in this amazingly beautiful world alone. I have played a couple of other ""survival"" games but this one actually gives you the total sense of isolation while communicating with you. You have no one to talk to but your PDA talks to you and it's not just mind numbing information. You can't talk to your PDA however were I really to be in this situation I would be talking back to my PDA the same way I talk to my screen when I play. Sometimes I laugh at the comments sometimes I'm just like ""No sharding Sherlock...."" but it really does communicate with you not just talk at you and by that I mean that the information is meaningful and not just data. I have found a place where the biome matches 9 out of the 9 conditions by the way and one of those conditions is a sense of hopelessness. I did however manage to limp my way back.The beauty of the game world is captivating and alive. You don't long for life and the place feels far far from dead. You do long for others however and being with others is always just out of grasp. Subnautica motivates you to do everything. It drives you to explore it drives you to build it drives you to work toward a sense of normalcy when there is no normal anymore. Subnautica pushes you to face your fears and to actually dive deeper in every aspect of the meaning. In the begining you are totally helpless and while that situation improves some you are NEVER the big fish. For all the tech at your disposal you have the means to survive but never the means to dominate. You are actually in over your head. Being in over your head however doesn't take away all hope ever and pushes you to explore and challenge yourself and go further and deeper.The sense of what could be never goes away the sense that you need to leave remains the sense that you will miss this place when you do grows and grows but you know one thing you can't stay and even knowing that you will miss this place and all the effort you put into it you know you can't really come back for a vacation either and if you did it wouldn't be the same. Part of the beauty is the isolation and the isolation while leading to despair at times is part of what makes it feel so amazing. Were you to live in this world with a group of people it would be ruined. Measures would be taken to ensure that humanity becomes the big fish and the big fish are part of what makes this world what it is. I wouldn't mind surviving with a partner but the one thing that is most out of place in this world is you and were anything to change it it would be ruined. That is part of why you can't stay I feel not just due to the isolation but because you are actually lucky to be alive and see what this world has to offer.",Subnautica

432783,2018-06-14,0,0,32,False,Recommended,I haven't written any reviews before and my english isn't really that good so bare with me. But for this game I just had to write a review.When I saw this game I thought it would be just a regular survival game but underwater. I thought that that was an interesting concept so I tried it for a bit. At first it really was just a survival game it looked amazing. The more I played and the more I explored I started to notice that there was more in this game then you would think. This game wasn't just an ordinary survival game you had a goal you had to escape this planet. Not only that this whole game had an amazing story line which would unfold by reading little PDA's which you would find by exploring . This game is so beautiful and I must say it was terrifying. There were moments were I really jumped there were moments were I felt like a hero because I would've done something that was really amazing. Another fun part of this game is that you can't really kill fish with weapons I think this makes sure that players don't just gather weapons and start killing everything this makes sure you have to play smart to make sure you don't die. I just finished the game this game is easily one of the best games i've ever played and I recommend this game to anyone who likes survival games and likes a little mystery that slowly unfolds.Now for the pros and cons Pros Beautiful graphics Music is amazing The sounds that you hear underwater are really well made and might be terrifying The story is amazing The way that you learn new items and new means of travel are really well thought of You really get the feeling that you are unraveling a mysteryCons There are little bugs that I found at the end but werent anything massive You get thrown in the game without explanation (Could be a positive thing depends on the player),Subnautica

432786,2018-01-24,1,1,44,False,Recommended,This game was an amzing survival and stragety genre i loved how the ocean gave you moments of pure beauty and even suspense out of the fear of the creatures in the depths the story was amazing even if the player was a silent protangonist the story was still being driven the music as well was perfected and it was something i liked listening to on my playthrough of it as it never got boring the ending which im not going to spoil was also very well produced and had that amazing epic feel to it where you get goosebumps not out of fear but out of awe instead but they topped it off nicely with a little funny one liner from the robotic PDA voice which i admit was quite funny The gameplay was also really good where i barely spotted any bugs and the graphics even on low were still something that would be covered by the baeuty of the ocean planet but when on high quality as i mostly spent my time with that setting set onto the settings it was just amazing i do definetly recomend this game as for its price it seems almost generous to have it sold at that price but it is still an amazing deal i recommend this game to anyone into survival genres and even thrilling genres too as sometimes it can get quite scary too.,Subnautica
432787,2018-06-30,0,0,134,False,Recommended,Heroes are a strange thing. In recent years the super heroes themselves are well known for killing and fighting. But the best kind of hero is the one who saves lives not those that end them. In Subnautica you are not simply a survivor you are a super hero of the rarest breed.*THIS WILL BE A SPOILER FREE REVIEW ANY DETAILS MENTIONED WILL NOT REVEAL ANY KEY STORYLINE FEATURES*To begin with this game is anything but a grind and that is unusual for survival games. If you have ever played games like Ark Survival Evolved then you will instantly see the contrast here. Subnautica is more about exploration and survival rather than driving you to do endless resource runs and build vast warehouses for your next base or whatever. In many ways the game is vastly more enjoyable due to this fact. Yes you have to look for materials but they are readily available and you only need small quantities for most craftable and buildable items. What's more exploration is not hampered like in games such as Ark as most creatures in Subnautica do not have the ability to ambush you and leave you wondering what hit you when you respawn. But what it does do is broadcast the presense of the creatures who are capable of doing some serious injury to you with audio clue that you hear long before you get within aggro range of them. And this moves me on to the next point.Subnautica is almost a survival horror game in how it presents itself. Not in the gory way but due to the tension it generates with the aforementioned predators. In some of the best horror movies you never saw the monster but you hear them somewhere in the dark this is how Subnautica can be truely nerve wracking at times too. The largest predators the ones that really need to be avoided at all costs tend to hang around specific areas of the oceans you never really feel safe in those areas even when you know roughly where they are. I took to marking their territory with bouys so that I would know that when I heard them they were in a specific direction usually. Since you can hear them from up to 300m away you generally need some indication that what you are hearing is not actually close enouh to be a threat else you end up constantly watching your back for no reason. You do eventually get provided with various vehicles and tools that give you a greater measure of protection. The Seaglide is a standard hand held engine which gives you some significant speed when swimming this in itself allows you to out run most predators with ease. The Seamoth is your first true vehicle a simple one man sub which gives you that added protection since anything that wants to eat you has to chew through the hull first. Moving up again you have the PRAWN mech suit which is far tougher than the Moth but not as fast. It's best used for mining the larger mineral deposits but is also the only way you can actually do damage to the local wildlife. It's not much but most predators tend to turn tail and run if you hit them twice. Finally you have the Cyclops sub this is a vehicle intended for a 3 man crew and due to it's size it is ignored by most predators. It becomes more like a mobile base of operations but its sluggish speed means you can't really explore with it unless you kind of know there is nothing dangerous where you are going. You can also dock the Seamoth or PRAWN into the sub so I would often dock the sub somewhere near to an unexplored region and then undock the PRAWN to scout the area first. But as i said it does get extremely tense when entering an unknown area especially the depths of the ocean where visibility to very poor at times and the only light is from bioluminesant flora and fauna. Or lava. Or rivers of green sulferous goo.Now this is not to say that the game is without bugs. The most common seem to be relating to the local wildlife being able to pass through solid geometry at times and this can really be frustrating if you suddenly have a very large predator appear from within a solid rockface and invite you to dinner. Or when you find the local goldfish 'swimming' through the corridors of your underwater base as if the air was as valid a substance to swim through as the water outside the bulkheads. Fortunaely these instances are not common but they do get annoying from time to time.All in all Subnautica will take you a good 50+ hours to really finish if you take the scenic route. The developers were kind enough to signpost your way through the objectives but as I eventually discovered it helped me a great to not just follow the breadcrumbs or else a lot of backtracking would have been needed. There is a measure of replay value here but the world is not randomly generated so once you've played through it once you'll lose the awe wonder and terror that the game produces in abundance during your first play through.Wholeheartedly recommended here's hoping more survival games take notice of what this title did so well.,Subnautica

432789,2015-09-01,0,0,14,True,Recommended,Very enjoyable game lovely visuals and mood great feeling of being a diver in an alien reef.I have two big beefs with it at the moment but I expect both to be solved with time because I have been VERY impressed with the frequent and substantial updates the developer is making to the game they are clearly commited and this is early in development still.The first issue is that there isn't much in the way of end game/late content. After playing it for 11 hours (that includes starting over a couple of times) there's just not much left to see or do. As I said though from their current track record I have every confidence that the developer will add more stuff until it has substantial gameplay. I'm only mentioning it so you know what you're going in to if you're buying it now and hoping to play a lot right away.Issue number 2 is... well myself and several others on the forum have serious issues with motion sickness in this game particularly when piloting the small SeaMoth vehicle. I can only play for small periods (10 mins or so) if using that vehicle before having to stop. I sincerely hope the controls will be tweaked to reduce the nausea.Final verdict Want to support a game that's almost assuredly going places and looks awesome? Put some bucks inthere now It's worth it. Want a substantial game to play and not just a bit of colourful exploring and crafting for a few hours? Wait with your purchase.,Subnautica

I've played the numbered Ace Combat games from 2 6 and to any series veteran wondering if its worthwhile I'll tell you this.If the previous Ace Combat games were that kid back in the 7th grade who was down to play Goldeneye or Mario Kart with you all day everyday.Ace Combat 7 is that same kid a decade and a half later after they age up and manage to become a gazebo owner and still is down to play those games with you.Even though 7 is all triple A and hella purdy grafixs planes now (and arguably flawed compared to the older games in it's story/amount of content) the gameplay feels just like it should with new things to keep it fresh like the new weather mechanics and there are still some throwbacks to previous games and traditional moments that make you go...YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS MY STIFF THOTTLE STICK IS COVERED IN VANILLA COLOURED MOTOR OIL RIGHT NOW AND I CAN'T EJECT OUT OF MY MESSY CANOPY or you know a similar sensation but less extreme of course.To those new to Ace Combat games I would definitely recommend picking this one up on a sale.If you have that feeling of ""wow I need a break from all these FPSs open worlds and sidescrollers and need a cool game out of the ordinary""This is that game right here.

432802,2019-02-01,6,358,27,False,Recommended,I'll start by making it abundantly clear that I am a huge fan of the ace combat series. I have played to 100% completion just about every one of them baring Assault Horizons which I don't view as an Ace Combat game. As such I feel it's important that I do my due diligence and write a review for those who come after me to determine if they wish to purchase this game.I'll start by clarifying that at the time of writing this there is a large amount of review bombing occuring so I will directly be refuting the points being made by the negative reviewers at the moment.1st There are claims this is a low grade console port.It has some alarmingly bad PC setup problems You can't change settings outside of basic flight control settings. IE inverting your controls and slightly altering flight style.2nd This game is meant to be played with a controller just like Darksouls from From Software.This is an arcade plane game. It has always been designed this way. If you expect 100% realism with complete HOTAS support from an Ace Combat game you've missed the point of Ace Combat. 3rd Bandai Namco is remaining silentThis is false they posted on the forums how to fix the problem with HOTAS until they can bug fix.https //steamcommunity.com/games/502500/announcements/detail/1729848148045983457This is the link. Stop screaming that they didn't do anything within 24 hours of release. Gods above.That out of the way my state in the game.Played through the campaign the first time beat it. Working on getting the rest of the planes and their upgradesI have not yet played Multiplayer.Yay Incredibly beautiful graphics. Amazingly optimized I experienced zero frame loss at the most intense moments of gameplay. I had 40 planes on screen at a point lasers flying to and from missiles everywhere. Flares being dumped left and right. No frame loss.Incredibly fun campaign encourages replayability with custom skins and unlocks which become available upon completion of certain requirements. Like previous games it adds aces which you can kill to unlock their special skins. To get them to appear you must perform to your highest in every mission ((Do certain things that enable them to spawn))Really fun high octane fast paced A classic Ace Combat gameReally good controller supportDecent difficulty rampX 02 Wyvern's backNay Feels hand holdy when it comes to landing/refueling... Makes me feel like I'm a baby and takes some of the fun out of it by essentially completing these tasks for me...It's an Arcade game so planes routinely do unrealistic things like high G maneuvers without their pilots passing out.((I was beyond confused the first time I seen an Su 30SM perform an Immelmann turn only to fly straight back down yo yo style before it ramped up to max speed within 2 seconds and juke off screen)) &lt This.Lack of PC settings that we all adore and love.Shortish campaign. 20 missionsIn closing I love this series I like this game. It's a great entry. I intend to keep playing as soon as my work schedule allows me to and my partner stops giving me dirty looks when I drool over the models of some of the planes. If you like Ace Combat Fires of Liberation and more specifically The Belkan War you'll love this game. Just keep in mind this is a console game being brought to PC it was always a console series and expecting their first game outside of Assault Horizons to be perfect is silly. I hope you will find this review helpful and enlightening!,ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN
432803,2019-02-03,5,149,3,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Disclaimer My copy of the game was provided by Bandai Namco Entertainment as thanks for my work at Acepedia the Ace Combat wiki. I also purchased the special collector's Strangereal Edition for PC but that code is going to someone else.My playtime here does not include the hours and hours I've spent playing this game on PS4. Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown is the return to form that Ace Combat has so desperately needed for over a decade. We haven't had a proper Ace Combat game in so long and while I loved Ace Combat Infinity to death it was a free to play game and not a complete experience.Ace Combat 7 is a complete experience. It features an enthralling detailed story that goes in directions you don't expect. It can be a little convoluted at times but this is part of the charm of Ace Combat storytelling figuring out the truth in the mess of conflict and strife. I daresay that this game is the most accurate of Ace Combat portrayals of the chaos of war. It all goes to hell as it should.The performance of the game on PC is astounding. The Steam version is truly the ultimate version of Ace Combat 7 with support up to 4K resolutions 8K supersampling uncapped framerates and any XInput gamepad you can plug into your computer... Yes the flight stick support is a little disappointing but that's not how Ace Combat was meant to be played anyway. The real disappointment here is the lack of in game TAA support draw distance options and removal of chromatic aberration and vignetting. Thankfully most of these can be fixed very quickly cleanly and easily. See the PC Gaming Wiki for details you'll definitely notice improvements.The presentation... my god this is the most gorgeous Ace Combat game ever created. The graphics. The music. The sound effects. The aircraft models. The cockpit models. Seeing my sweet baby the X 02 and Stonehenge in full HD. And it's not 110% realistic there's some expert shading and design work at play that makes it look uniquely Ace Combat while remaining close enough to reality that you can enjoy it fully.The real big disappointment for me is the multiplayer component. This isn't something that affects my personal opinion of the game itself as I care far more for the single player experience. But many fans myself included were hoping for an online cooperative experience like Ace Combat Infinity since that game showed just how well Ace Combat works with PvE multiplayer. Instead the multiplayer here is very barebones with just TDM and FFA. A shame. Not enough to make me dislike this game but still a shame.For all of those who have been looking for a chance to dip into the Ace Combat franchise this is your gateway. Ace Combat 7 retains the incredible unparalleled gameplay everyone has come to expect from Ace Combat and everything else (besides the lackluster multiplayer) has raised the bars to match. It's here. It's beautiful. It's time.,ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN
432804,2019-01-31,14,640,21,False,Recommended,Edit I've now completed the campaign and I wholeheartedly stand behind my appreciation of the game after the first three missions (which is described in the following review). Other users have also pointed out that the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro is not supported (although I've seen reports of people using unsupported sticks with a controller emulator).As you can see from my playtime I've only completed three missions so far so don't take this review as something written by someone who completed the game because that's not currently true. With that out of the way I'd like to leave a positive rating to help people who do not have a HOTAS at their disposal and would like to know if the game runs well (and is as good as previous Ace Combat titles).Playing with an Xbox 360 joystick on a 4770k 16gb RAM GTX 1070 machine running at 1080p I'm getting a near locked 120fps maxed. So the PC version is far from badly optimized. The planes control very well with the 360 pad and if I can find my Extreme 3D Pro I'll report back on that as well.I read that 4K support is in actually though other people report that's not the case so if that's important to you there's a chance it might not work.Otherwise the game is excellent so far with clear mission objectives beautiful graphics and outstanding gameplay that more than makes up for the travesty that was Assault Horizon.,ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN

432806,2019-02-01,9,141,17,False,Recommended,I have absolutely no idea what s going on and I m loving every second of itAce Combat 7 Skies Unknown is the most recent and long awaited instalment in the Ace Combat franchise. This is my first Ace Combat game so my understanding of the story is limited to you re some guy being ordered by some other guy to help defend one country that sounds an awful lot like the country you re attacking. The story really is as confusing as it is ridiculous but maybe that s just because this is my first game in the franchise.Positives It s just great fun. I love arcade flight games and one of the main reasons is because it s just non stop ridiculous action and AC7 is no different. Tearing through the skies at insane speeds and then doing what s effectively a handbrake turn to get the drop on your enemy is just so satisfying especially when you blow them up and get to fly through the explosion.The controls are tight and the planes feel nice and responsive. This is obviously super important for any flight game but particularly important here in this fast paced action a thon. So far I ve unlocked and flown about seven different planes and each one does feel unique. For example the A 10 feels a lot heavier than the Gripen I d highly recommend not using the A 10 in a dogfight!There s a great variety of different planes and weapons to choose from. Initially you start with one (three if you have the launch edition though one of those doesn t have combat capabilities) and more are unlocked by spending MRP in the Aircraft tree. MRP is earned by completing campaign missions and multiplayer matches if you re really trying to unlock something you do earn more MRP in multiplayer so it might be worth grinding a little bit.The multiplayer is surprisingly fun. Typically I don t play multiplayer at all but I decided to try it out last night and it was really good fun. You have a battle royal mode which is an eight person free for all and a team deathmatch where players are put into teams and face off against each other. I think the battle royal mode is a bit more enjoyable and more suited to this kind of game but they were both good fun. I was a little concerned about how few people were playing the multiplayer but I m assuming that most people were just too busy playing through the campaign.There s enemy AI seems very competent. I ve been playing on normal and while I haven t been having too much trouble dodging missiles (yet) some of the enemies are pretty agile and it takes some chasing to shoot them down. There s been a good balance in the missions so far between ground enemies fighters drones and bombers. I haven t felt bored by what I m fighting. Despite the story being well weird and confusing the voice acting is actually really good. I was expecting the voices to be super cheesy but actually it s quite nice hearing the chatter during the missions brings some more life to the game. Also the rest of the sound effects and music are good too. As far as I can tell so far no map is re used. If this is the case then that means twenty different maps which is great. All of the maps I ve seen so far in the campaign and multiplayer have been well designed and nice to look at. There s one map I played in multiplayer that had these towering rock formations that were great fun to dodge in and out of. There s also a free flight mode so you can always go back and just be a tourist in your multi million dollar jet.There are two replays at the end of each mission which are really cool. The first is a regular replay you can watch how you played the mission while changing camera angles speeding it up or slowing it down and you can toggle the display if you want to grab some nice screenshots. I would have liked more fast forward/rewind options and scrubbing would have been good but it s a fun little feature nonetheless. The second replay comes while you re watching your points get tallied up after the mission it s basically neon arrows flying around a black box which may not sound super interesting but the arrows actually do a great job showing off the different manoeuvres you pulled off. These replays aren t something I m going to watch at the end of each mission but I m really glad they re in the game.Speaking of replays replaying the missions with different planes/to get higher scores is a lot of fun and I ve actually already gone back to do that despite only being a few missions in. I haven t achieved any S ranks yet but I m trying to get all A s (hope my parents are proud!)It runs really well. I have a pretty modest laptop and I m having absolutely no trouble running it on medium at 1080p.Negatives The game has launched with broken HOTAS support which has led to the game being review bombed. Personally I prefer playing these kinds of arcade flying games with a controller rather than my HOTAS but I felt it was important to include this anyway. I m hoping we ll see a fix soon so the reviews can start to reflect how much fun the game is.This probably isn t a big deal to many other people but I m really disappointed that there s no take off and landings in the free flight mode. One of my favourite parts of HAWX 2 was doing the full take off and landing in free flight mode some of the missions even let you taxi. Free flight mode is much less interesting without this in my opinion. Here s hoping Project Wingman will include it.I would have liked to see another singleplayer mode in here something like a wave based mode where you fight increasingly more numerous and difficult enemies. It s not a huge deal that there s nothing like that but it would add some more replay value to the game. Verdict Ace Combat 7 Skies Unknown is an absolute blast the story is utterly ridiculous but the action more than makes up for it. There are a couple of things that let it down a little bit but if you re a fan of arcade flight games then this is an absolute must have.If you found this review helpful please check out my other reviews over at Kemo's Corner.,ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN

You have two choices join your friends escape the horrors or be left for dead.Left 4 Dead 2 is the classic Zombie Survival Shooter made by the greatest minds of Valve. This is one of my favorite coop games out in the market today. GAMEPLAY The game is fun and challenging. The different chapters give out a new style of gameplay. The game offers a wide array of weapons. The zombie types is where the game shines. Jockey Spitter Smoker Charger Boomer Hunter Witch and Tank zombies will hinder your success. These zombies will join the normal zombie horde to lower your survival rate. Trust me a jockey charger and smoker simultaneous attack can leave the group in disarray and will be easy pickings for the normal zombies. Everytime you finish a segment of the chapter you and your friends get a feeling of relief that the worst is over but you know you guys are wrong about that conclusion. STORY and CHARACTERS Left 4 Dead 2 is about the story of four new survivors Coach Ellis Nick and Rochelle. Each has their own backstory and their own traits which you can see through their different dialogue throughout the game.All in all Left 4 Dead 2 is a 9/10.

I have to be honest I'm not a MPG fan per se however what I enjoyed about L4D2 and it's original is that you work together. You can be that hero and save all the others. You can kill the Tank whilst your team mates are all injured. You can sacrifice yourself for the good of the team. There are so many standout moments that I have had playing this. I'm not the best gamer in the world but with L4D2 it really doesn't matter it's about teamwork and pulling together making sure you have someone's back flinging the pipe bomb at just the right moment sniping that smoker right before he strangles a team mate.Best zombie game in my opinion and when I want to play something fun I'll always load this game up just stay away from that witch!,Left 4 Dead 2

432885,2016-02-10,17,203,529,False,Recommended,Yes this game is good. It's worth buying. Yes even after almost 7 years after the release people still play it even despite the fact it didn't really receive any new content. Why? Well let me explain.Is it good because of graphics? Totally not. Even for early 2010's graphics weren't anything that impressive. It's still almost the same Source engine which powered Half Life 2 and episodes. Yes it was constantly updated but it didn't really progress. I mean we still have the same concept from early 90's a game server hosts a map and up to 16 or 32 (or even 64 in some modifications) players can join and move around the map. You can reach certain points of the map and it will load another map. And that's all about it. But it's not open world in any sense. It's something that reminds me of Doom and Quake games. In fact Source was partially based on Quake engine after all.But don't think graphics are bad. No they are pretty enjoyable. I just don't recall technological advancement being a major selling point for this game. The game can impress you sometimes. Some textures look really dated. But overall it's just there. The game graphics won't make you scream in excitement nor it will disappoint you even in 2016. A lot of stuff is destructible. I saw hours spent on zombie animations infected puke beat eachother walk around die spectacularly if killed. It's nice to see actual damage done to their zombies' bodies some severe dismemberment and burning. But some may say graphics are kinda old. (Please don't think I'm one of these guys who only cares about polygons and realism I'm just getting started.)So maybe the story is the main element here? Nope you can complete the entire game without even learning anything about the characters or what's actually going on. You and 3 other people are given a selection of weaponry medical supplies some other stuff. You have a very simple goal get to your destination or do something. Just get out of there alive.So why anything from 10 to 20 thousand people are playing this game right now? Why so many people played it for two or three thousand hours? Because of gameplay.Words cannot describe how many different situations there are. There are only 10 or so types of enemies 3 basic types of main weapons a few different secondary weapons grenades and other items. And that's it. I know it may sound a lot at first but very quickly you acquire a taste for a favorite combination of weapons and items.Left 4 Dead series somehow manage to make people spend thousands of hours of their time playing the same set of maps. And it's a corridor shooter which means there is only one way to achieve your destination. How it's done then? Well every time different items get generated in different places you get zombies from different spawn points. You can play the same maps over and over again and again. And people actually do.Speaking of people it's a multiplayer. Yes there is single player mode where you can complete campaign with bots. But the most fun is playing with people. I find PvE aspect extremely interesting. Keep in mind your enjoyment really depends on people you play with. This game is about cooperation you will never be able to complete it alone. So you have to find a server with good players maybe you should play with friends maybe you should make friends with people who play properly. Playing with bunch of griefers will suck. Playing with someone who actually wants to play is the best thing since sliced bread. Holy crap you have to help eachother. Someone shares a medkit with you. His medkit. A medkit is being spent to restore your health you wasted because you made bunch of mistakes. But someone helps you for some reason. And you help them back sharing resources with them. Oh and keep in mind there is no reward system for helping others.There is PvP where you play as a bunch of zombies against a team of survivors controlled by other players. But I don't think it's as good as regular campaign. If someone thinks you are bad for the team they just kick you out. Call me a weirdo but I play it because of sense of fellowship or at least some basic positive human interaction. I don't really like the idea that someone may feel bad because I outsmarted them.I think I finally cracked Valve's logic. The main thing about a videogame is gameplay. This is exactly why we have these debates %gamename% isn't a real videogame!!11 and other stuff. It's gameplay first. Yes you need amazing visuals to make a masterpiece but it isn't the main thing you should focus on. I heard about Crysis as a game with great graphics many years ago finally I decided to give it a try. I was utterly bored after a couple of hours its gameplay was dull. Yes you need story and great sound effects. But they still are only an excuse for gameplay.Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't fail to illustrate this concept. You can play it right away you don't have to read wiki for 2 hours to craft a pickaxe or to build a basic rocket to orbit Kerbin. It takes minutes to learn basic concepts. Easy to learn difficult to master yes we have it. But after a couple of hours I began to care about the story. You play as one of 4 characters who are they? Turns out they are almost real people with some depth to them. Not too much just enough to understand how they feel about each other. The whole story of zombie virus is told through surroundings. You see countless writings on the walls a lot of documents are scattered around. The story told not using some boring and forced cutscenes but using details. You may skip story elements if you don't care about it. Or you may spend hours reading L4D wiki like I did.Valve remembers that this is a game. If you look through L4D concept art you will see that survivors were supposed to look a lot more different. They wore a lot more utilitarian gear. In the final game they are wearing casual clothing which helps to establish who they were before the outbreak. I mean look at Rochelle's ear rings. I know what zombies would tear away first. It's unrealistic and is it bad? Nope it's fine it's a videogame not a reflection of reality.There is a lot of stuff in Left 4 Dead series which have never been done before. Developers added commentaries in game how they ended up creating everything it's really interesting to check out. And I think I finally understand Valve's logic they create games with some new elements. They create a game it succeeds. Then they make a sequel which feels much better they implement everything they need to make a great videogame experience. This is exactly what happened to Portal and Portal 2 Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. This is exactly why Half Life 3 may never happen what exactly new can you say about first person shooter genre? It was told so many times it's really hard to come up with something new. And this is exactly why they keep working on Left 4 Dead 3. At least it seems they are working on it. After all Left 4 Dead 2 appears to be incomplete to me. I feel like you can add more stuff in this concept.But right now it's totally worth spending money on Left 4 Dead 2. It's a very addictive game and most importantly people are still playing it. If you get bored there are tons of content in Steam Workshop you can b a s t a r d ize the game with (if in you are in that kind of stuff).,Left 4 Dead 2

433032,2015-08-16,724,2396,1094,True,Recommended,"This is a review of the offline game. This game has been one of the best games I have ever played. I have been playing games for over 25 years and haven't experienced a game this epic. I'd like to share one of my quests. I had just finished my first base on a peninsula. It had a bed and some storage containers and was starting to feel pretty safe. I hadn't seen many dangerous Dino other that dilos (the ones that killed the fat guy in Jurassic park). I had stockpiled some goods and decided I would go try to tame something worth taming. I found a raptor in a valley surrounded by rocks and decided he was gonna be my buddy. The taming process was pretty intense so it really made me want to keep my Raptor safe. I saddled him up and decided to give him a go. He was amazing we ran around killing everything. After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest. We ran through the night and in the morning i realized how extra lost i was and got worried. I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around. After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were. Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me. After I respawned back at my base I was in panic mode and jumped on my only other ride able Dino which was a Parasaur and hauled back to where my raptor was. We never made it. About halfway there we were attacked by a pack of raptors and both were killed. My next re spawn was kinda bleak from the start. I re spawn in a random location that I thought would be near my Dino. After what seemed like hours of carefully navigating my map back to where i though my Dino was I started to freeze and starve. I would move thirty to fifty feet and whistle then repeat. The sun went down and my hopes for recovering my dino with it. Just as I had given up hope I was surrounded by scorpions and I thought ""oh well"". A second later my Raptor jumped down from the rocky ledges above and killed one of the scorpions. I frantically jumped on his back and ran from the other scorpions. My health was still falling due to the cold and me starving. Once we got to relative safety I hopped off his back and checked his inventory. Somehow he had collected a full suit of armor and plenty of berries whilst we were hunting earlier. We eventually dodged meat eaters and found our way home once the sun rose. I have never felt that since of disparity and relief from a video game before. It sounds funny but it really felt like the raptor saved my life. I've never got that into a game before. That one experience was worth more than what I paid for the game.",ARK: Survival Evolved

433037,2016-09-08,0,0,714,True,Not Recommended,Ark Evolved has provided me with hundreds of hours of entertainment. It was an example of Early Access done right. But with diverting more and more resources to other projects without actually finishing the core game and now the unprecedented release of paid DLC before the game is even finished I can no longer support or recommend this game.,ARK: Survival Evolved
433038,2015-12-21,0,0,64,True,Recommended,Really good game! Needs a lot more updates not just adding dinos! I hate the bugs though. They are updating the game a lot and making it more playable. Remember the first day it came out? It was unplayable with bugs lags etc. I mean the dinos were teleporting everywhere and stuff haha. Yeah this game is really good I have it on all of my steam accounts. The game is being updated a lot but realistically they are just adding items and dinos to the game but not REALLY focussing on bugs to be fair. I run a dedicated server on the game I would like more things added to the servers like admin commands you cant even fly because you go super slow its pointless. The game does have a high potential.,ARK: Survival Evolved
433039,2015-10-27,0,0,1426,True,Recommended,Greetings one and all. I want to express my feelings on this game. My experience. But first I will roll with the pro's and the cons.Pros 1.Breathtaking game with beautiful (as well as immersive) scenery 2.It's not just PvP it is PvPE . In other words you have to watch your back for both players and the environment. 3.It does have a PvE setting for those who desire less stressful gameplay 4.Easy to learn game for anyone starting! Hours of fun! 5. And for those that got ripped from Stomping Land this game is CONSTANTLY updating with new features! Even getting it now while it's still in early access isn't a bad thing! This game isn't so broken it isn't playable AND enjoyable! 6. Tamable Species of all sorts! ((Not just dinos anymore folks!)) Anywhere from prehistoric mammals and dinos to unique sealife! 7. This game prides itself to work together with others. Sure you can go play solo in a server if you wanted. But official servers you are limited with how much knowledge you can gain. So this also limits your crafting? Is this a bad thing? No. It strives people to work together or for those solo players out there. A challenge in the fact that you can overlook this hinderance by finding the blueprints within unique crates that appear randomly over the island!8. Mod friendly! That's right folks! The Dev team has offered the option for player's themselves to make mods to even further the content of this game! You will find thousands of community made mods to enhance your gameplay!Now the Cons1. The game is still in early access. Which means you will run into random glitches that can cause some hinderance in gameplay. ((Fun part is the Dev team knows about these glitches and if you find one they may have skipped? You can actually message the dev team via forums and they WILL answer!))2. Hackers. yes this is a problem in most games. The official servers cane be crawling with them. ((Fun part! Their are several servers and even unofficial servers ran by other players! Also contacting the dev team via forums you will find a thread dedicated in finding such hackers or hacks in the game so they can prevent them with their anti cheat system!))3. Playing alone can be difficult to most and even if you are a social butterfly some people may find it hard to welcome you with open arms. Players are indeed ruthless and the environment even more so. ((if you were me however you will consider this a challange! &gt D))4. Official Servers. They are good and bad depending on how you look at it. Sometimes it's just the server itself always constantly full or maybe the tame rate for some of these creatures are too much for those who want to devote their time to this game. Fear not! That is why they also offer Unnoffical servers! 5. Mod Friendly. This is both a good and bad thing. Mods are fun! They enhance gameplay whether you are looking for more immersion or straight up silliness. However playermade mods can be gamebreaking. Causing errors to the server and/or issues with the actual gameplay once installed. So be careful and read carefully which mods you are adding in!Overall I utterly enjoy this game! I've always been a big dinosaur nut ((or prehistoric nut in this case!)) ever since I was little and for the Dev team of this game to finally come out with something enjoyable and immersive like this? Makes my inner child scream with joy! Take it from me ((a victim of the stomping land fiasco)) This game is worth ir's weight in gold! ((or in this case cash! XD)) Until then friends this is Vaughne signing off! I'll see you in the game!,ARK: Survival Evolved
433040,2017-08-30,0,0,1062,False,Not Recommended,Though the basic idea is a good one the game itself suffers from unprofessionel developers. Actually I cannot recall a single release date or promise that wildcard did actually could hold. They NEVER release on the promised date and the ALWAYS miss at least half the promised stuff. Best example is the last 'Release Update'.The promised Fully working game with virtually no bugs left two new creatures Otter and Phoenix new gear ability to download ice wyvernsThey delivered most of the old bugs still remain collision has never worked with this game that has not changed clipping and falling through the landscape still are common also a lot of sync issues. I seriously doubt the devs ability to fix this ever... of the 2 creatures a single one is available for only PC (not Xbox/Palystation) no new gear no ability to download the ice wyvernsAnd this is not a special thing it's like that for the last 2 years on every single release date. That makes up my impression of dealing with a group of hobby developers that are really far away from any competence. Interestingly they have a great mod community that does a lot of those things that the devs are not capable of.All in all Good idea done badly. The release price is totally out of this world but wildcards are really quite greedy They even released a DLC for the game in it'S unfinished state. If you see this here on a sale for under 20 bucks go for it... and bring a lot of patience as the inofficial ark slogan is it's not a bug it'S a feature ),ARK: Survival Evolved

433045,2017-09-01,0,0,1250,False,Not Recommended,Was a great game for a while in the early months. The devs started adding too much content in my opinion they should have just kept it a primitive dinosaur game but they had to add all this tek and high tier t which I felt ruined the game. All my friends and I had so much fun when it was just simple and primitive with dinosaur pvp and not trexes shooting lazers out of their ing saddles and flying birds holding tens of thousands of pounds of stuff on their back. What has really motivated me to write this negative review for Ark is this outragous price this game should be no more than 25 dollars. The state of the official servers are a joke. Unless you're playing with a tribe of 35 people and can get past the spawn huts built by the tribes who have been on the server since the game came out(yes the official servers have never been wiped) it's almost impossible to get started. with the addition on Tek to the game it has made it even harder for the new player to start. If they want to jack the price up to 60 dollars they better put more work into the official servers and bugs litering the game.,ARK: Survival Evolved
433046,2017-05-05,92,2412,531,True,Not Recommended,"I have over 200 hours into the game compared to a lot of ARK players i'm still a noob so if you aren't ready to turn this into a full time job don't even bother thinking about getting this game. I'll explain why this game is a full time job later on but basically it punishes any player that can't or won't play it 24/7. First I'll talk about the PvE. I started playing PvE on a private server with friends and had tons of fun discovering everything there is to enjoy. We started on The Center the biggest and in my opinion the coolest of the three maps. The beginning is the hardest part for new players. Every dino you meet can easily kill a noob even the spitter dinos. It can be annoying running around naked and getting killed by raptors but stick with it and find your friends and build a safe place. Once you get the base built the game gets so much more fun. Every new dino you find is cool and it so fun the first time you get all your friends together and explore a cave. The most dangerous foes we encountered in PvE were the alpha predators. Our base got killed multiple times by alpha raptors but it was fun because it showed us that even though we had a big base with spike walls and gaurd towers there was still a threat out there that had to be beaten. Ofcourse once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymore and once you tame flying mounts you don't have to worry about dangerous expeditions so late game it got boring. We basically got to the point that nothing PvE had to throw at us outside of boss battles was a challenge and even fighting bosses had no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill? Harder versions of that boss? That's why we decided to turn to PvP to see if that was better late game.Pro tip don't PvP. This game is designed in such a way that the big tribes that are on top stay on top. New tribes and new players just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave. Let's walk through all the reason PvP is horrible.1.) Alpha tribes. They wipe the server once or twice a week and completly blow up any new players base and kill their dinos. They own the server they won't let anyone else even enjoy the game.2.) Unless you're alpha you don't get a base they might let you live in a thatch hut. Refer to reason 1.) 3.) Unless you're alpha you don't get to tame dinos they might let you tame dodos. Refer to reason 1.)4.) Unless you're alpha you don't get to upgrade any of your gear. Alphas block all loot drops (the good ones anyway) and fill all the caves with auto turrets to gun down anyone that tries to explore them.5.) Alpha tribes are literally impossible for smaller tribes to fight. They have huge metal bases with hundreds and hunderds of turrets and plants that will mow you down if you so much as look at it wrong. Rockets get shot down in mid air by these turrets and you won't get close enough to plant c4. You won't be able to bring dinos to tank the turret either refer to 1.)6.) Offline raiding. Just imagine working for 2 3 weeks building a pretty cool base completely surrounded by plant x and taming about 20 dinos then logging on to see a smoking crater where you base was. You don't get to save any of your gear you don't get to save any of your dinos you don't even get to fight back it's all just gone. This happens all the time and honestly offline raid protection should be baseline on all servers.7.) Battlemetrics. Alpha tribes and griefers use this website to figure out if you are online or not. If you log off for some reason sleep or work or whatever then they will know and they will raid you. They can even get text alerts that tell them the second you have logged off or on or if anything else unusual is going on on ""their"" server. Basically this site and sites like it are cancer. Also it doesn't tell them your in game name but you steam name that means even if you make another character they will know it's you. Also if you them off and try to go to another server they can just look up where you went using Battlemetrics and come find you. There is no hiding and no escape so you have to be nice and can't even PvP or else some loser with no life is going to come and find you on every single server you go to.8.) Breeding. Just another way to keep big tribes ontop. They have huge metal air conditioned rooms where they hatch 20 eggs at once each hatched dino gonna be 2x the level of anything a noob will have.9.) Tek gear. If the fact that they have 2 3x better gear by monopolizing all loot crates wasn't a big enough edge if the fact that they have 2 3x better dinos by building huge breeding rooms wasn't a big enough edge now they get tek gear too. If they come at you with anything tek and you have baseline gear and baseline dinos you are DEAD!10.) Ark is a full time job. You must log on every day to feed dinos or they will die. Breeding and imprinting are horrible and time consuming processes that I won't even touch. You must log on every day to make sure you haven't been raided and you must grind harder than everyone else to make sure you have the defenses and dinos to stop raiders. Don't try you won't. Look I'm tired of typing this review just know that if you enjoy PvP because you enjoy winning through skill then don't PvP. No Pvp skill required at this point their gear will have much higher armor and damage their dinos will have much higher hp and damage just accept your death and wipe multiple times because you will lose everything and you won't even be online to defend it not like you'd have a chance if you were.EDIT I never expected my review to actually be popular but now that it is I feel like I should address all the kids telling me I suck and that I'm still a noob who doesn't know what he's talking about.Firstly this is NOT a skill based game. This is a grind based offline raid based exploit based game. You can't come here and say I'm a noob especially when I've played the game solo as a small tribe for over 300 hours and I joined an alpha tribe for a week or two so I know how it goes on a larger scale. My opinion actually got even worse after joining the aplha tribe because I realized just how bad the game panders to these alpha tribes. Here are some more reasons I found from my time with the alphas why I will never recommend this game to anyone.1.) Alpha tribes can grind resources WAY easier than a new player. Now you would probably expect this. After all they have more players so it is only natural that they could send 5 out to grind while your tribe could only spare 1. No numbers isn't even what I'm talking about here I'm talking about EXPLOITS with a farming dino and a Quetzal. A noob with a hatchet can get 50 60 wood from a single tree. An alpha tribe can get 1500 wood from a single tree. A noob with a pickaxe can get 50 60 metal from a vein an alpha tribe can get 300 metal from a vein. A noob would take hours to farm 1 2k metal an alpha tribe can farm 20 30k metal in an hour. The list goes on and every single resource you can think of they can get insane amounts much faster and easier. Now noobs wont know how to do this and wouldn't be able to because Quetzals are hard to tame and hard to hide from alpha tribes. If they saw you flying around harvesting they would bring a Wyvern after you and start looking for your base.2.) Large scale PvP is extremely laggy. The servers are supposed to support up to 100 players but if you get more than 20 players in a server the lag becomes unbearable. Once again Alpha tribes exploit this by logging as many people as they can onto a server (kind of like DDOS) to block out defenders from connecting or to force the server to get so laggy that you can basically avoid taking damage from things.",ARK: Survival Evolved

433048,2017-08-30,0,0,170,False,Not Recommended,Bought this game a while back when it was only $29.99. Pretty good buy back then because the game was rough but the content was streaming in before the console drops. Now I can only log in half of the time and when I do I spend the first 5 6 minutes every few feet rendering after having already waited a solid 8 minutes to login (Not even mentioning the massive amount of memory this game takes just to install). Don't get me wrong the game is okay aside from cheaters hats and random glitches. But Optimization should have been a priority over the bloated content within the game. Hell the Devs dropped an expansion during early access before it was even released and they didn't even give it to the people who bought the early access for free. Now they are selling it full price as well as the expansion which is an absurdity that cannot be made up. These early access games are the P2P Candy Crushes and Farmvilles of the real gaming world deliberately squeezing the funds out of fan boys just to make it seem more appealing to casuals while not supporting the real player base. You can make all the cool items/gear/loot to your hearts content but if the game doesn't function then that stuff has absolutely no value.

433050,2016-09-08,1,7,26,True,Not Recommended,I have owned ark for a year now and from my perspective it is not worth buying I am the type of gamer who likes to run games at max settings and I play at a high resolution of 3440x1440 but I also have a good computer to back it up 2x gtx 980ti's now I know sli isn't supported in every game but honestly it is supported in most and in a game this demanding the developers really need to support sli because with my 2 980ti's at 3440x1440 i get 20 fps on a mixture of high and low settings which after being out this long is pretty abismal to be honest. I mean cmon I run witcher 3 ultra hairworks on at that resolution getting 60+ fps. So if your the kind of gamer who games at 1080p and doesnt care if everything is on low settings then the game is fun! lots of fun but for me it just isn't i load the game up every now and then to see if performance has improved and nope same old 20 fps.,ARK: Survival Evolved

433053,2016-05-30,0,0,7448,True,Recommended,My 2000+ hours show my obvious love for the game. This has to be the best early access that I have played. Yes it has its' bugs .. but they are minimal bearable and the devs are always quick to rectify the problem. With the addition of mods this game is now my favourite game. You can play it solo but for a better experience ... playing in a tribe is awesome. The emmersion in this game is 10/10. Highly recommend this to anyone and everyone.Like other games though .. it should be known that every user will have different experiences which are mostly determined by their computer specs.

433054,2015-06-29,130,1795,189,True,Recommended,Since most people are bashing the PvP servers for the griefing I feel like someone should answer that and also talk a bit about the PvE servers.Right now I got close to 130 hours in the game about half of that on PvP servers and half of that on PvE all official ones. All the thing people say about the griefers is true they'll kill your dinos steal your stuff abuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep. In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players. And that's the keyword here TRIBES. If you're playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that you're not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with it's little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos. Slowly learning the game by yourself taking everything in eventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forth.I'm sorry but I got to burst your bubble right now If you plan on playing in a PvP server you gotta take this game seriously. You either find a group of friends to play with you or you join a Tribe as soon as possible. If you play alone you might find a hidden spot where your stuf will be safe one or two nights maybe even a week but alone you're doomed to be found robbed and killed. And like many others said have the work of a whole week go down the drain. If you're joining a PvP server you're doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure you thing can get really intense really epic pretty fast. With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deaths or tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havok T Rexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at them auto turrets spewing bullets at your Carno army Sabretooths leaping over walls. It is a beauty to behold.But you'll only experience that if you join one of the dominating tribes on your server or work on creating a strong Tribe of your own. Otherwise you'll just be cattle for them nothing else. They'll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccess block caverns so only they can harvest the resources literally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so on.I get why so much people hate that after all they're just being preayed upon they're not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars. But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right now they gotta allow people to be complete a holes because during wars that's what you gotta be. If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and stale.But if everything I said right now put you off don't be. First of all because you don't really need PvP for this game to be fun. There's a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace. I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 60 hours right now. And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinos just hit level 45 and I feel like I'll never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day. People are also very helpful on PvE servers they'll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rex help you gather Prime meat when you're taming a Carnivore give you tips and materials. At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about them.And if you're still one of the guys who wanna grow at your pace and only participate on PvP when you're ready REJOICE! Because they'll soon add War Declaration to PvE servers so tribes can actually go at war when they feel like it without all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselves.As a closing statement I'd like to congratulate the Devs. They're doing a terrific job. Optimization is alreayd a LOT better still not there yet but much better. The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming. Bugs are rarer and rarer in fact I don't even remember the last time I experienced one.An all around great game that I fully recommend if you're into dinossaurs and survival games. Oh and it's also pretty cheap.,ARK: Survival Evolved

433056,2017-09-21,0,0,1983,False,Recommended,"After so long I've decided to finally review this game. I bought this game shortly after it was up for sale in 2015 and the game has come a long time since then. Looking through these reviews talking about performance issues I can honestly say that I haven't had any performance issues since maybe early 2016 when the game was in its infancy still. My pc is 5 years old and it runs this on a mix of high/ultra at 60fps+. That's not to say the game doesn't have its issues bugs dupers and other botters but what game doesn't? It seems people are too lazy to google ""improve performance ark"" or something like that since there is a few easy things anyone can do to improve performance by a bit. I've played on both official and unofficial servers ill talk briefly about my experience.I've put in the bulk of my hours(1600 in fact) into one official server and while I love this game the official servers are brutal. Playing on these is a MASSIVE time investment and I mean MASSIVE. It takes a long time to do anything and starting on an official is brutal much more so if it's a pvp server.As far as unofficial servers go if you can find one with higher rates and a decent friendly community then you're all set get in there and enjoy the game.The bottom line is that yes the game has its issues as any other game does. There is a steady stream of content being added continuously and the game is ultimately fun. If you're on the fence about it don't take all the negative reviews for fact if you want to try it then jump in and try it. And unless you have alot of time or are a masochist then try find yourself a nice unofficial server to begin with.",ARK: Survival Evolved
433057,2017-04-01,0,0,867,True,Not Recommended,The only reason I can gather that this game is immediately 67% off following the update is because nobody wants to play it anymore. Well done.Maybe if they undid some of the damage this past update just caused it would sell for more than $10.

Finish the current game without spontaneously destroying your player base's experience would be my recommendation.,ARK: Survival Evolved
433058,2015-11-27,7,13,116,True,Not Recommended,"Game goes like this Create character choose location spawn in and spend time looking around and scratching your arm where you are unable to move or act and a random carnivore starts to chase you if you lucky enough for it to be far enough away before you stop scratching your arm and looking around then you actually live to try outrun it and inevitably run into something else just as deadly... usually this is not the case before you are able to move you are one hit by said carnivore.Sometimes you are lucky enough to spawn in a less dangerous area like maybe in the snow where you quickly catch a cold and die.If you are lucky enough not to die by one of the 2 ways above then you probably will get stuck in the ground and have to wait till you die of starvation in order to randomly spawn again and probably die by one of the above.If you still manage to survive all of these things then lets talk about combat you manage to make a spear and try hunt something in order not to die of starvation you find something low enough lvl you can probably kill but unfortunately even though you are playing on a server where your ping is between 30 and 60 the animal teleports about and your miss stabs turn into exhaustion and you fall asleep the animal then kills you while you ""tor por"".I tried returning this game after playing it for 8 hours because I found it buggy and unplayable when I got stuck in the ground (and there is no unstuck command or suicide I even tried eating spoiled meat and my own feces) but they refused.So I thought what the hell ill give it another go guess what.. nope still a pile of feces. would definitely not recommend.",ARK: Survival Evolved

433060,2016-04-20,332,1264,1084,True,Recommended,Note At least 1000 of my hours were spent on Official Servers. Thus my review will pertain to Official Servers.Ark Survival Evolved is a game that will make you feel many things. Initially you will feel frustration at your helplessness as you spawn nude on a beach at level one and can barely fend off the smallest of dinosaurs. Then you will meet people these people will either be total jerks and just kill you over and over or they will be really chill and you'll form a tribe with them. You will spend countless hours with these people farming materials taming dinosaurs and build bases. You will grow more and more in power. You will be meeting other players either passing through the server or settling down. You will know all the other tribes on the server that are worth knowing (i.e. the big tribes or friendly tribes). You will come across numerous other cultures as you find Chinese tribes and Spanish tribes French and German all while growing more and more powerful. You will on occassion have a set back but at this point you're on a roll and now the games mechanics have a good group of friends and objectives that you have given yourself. You will feel happy with what you have accomplished. But there is a downside. There must always be conflict while it can be delayed for long periods of time it will eventually come. And so another tribe will pick a fight with you. Your tribe will fight their tribe and you may lose or you may win. Either way you've invested a lot into this server and these friends so you'll never give up. Some other tribes will jointhe fight picking sides. The winning side will probably kill all the dinos take all the mats and kill everyone on the losing side. Thus you have won your first war. You are now a power on the server worth being reckoned with. Soon enough you'll get in an even bigger war as the losing side draws more and more people to aide them and you respond by getting more as well. Now the entire server is split 50 50 and a great war mars the server for days as both sides are constantly wiping one anothers bases. Eventually you'll win though and the other side will leave the server. They'll be fed up. As the enemies are now gone you are happy once more. You hated them just as they hated you. Now a long period of peace has passed a couple weeks. There is trouble brewing as a few of your allies are begin to grow wrestless and have infighting. Peace will try to be maintained through talks. But it will fail in the end and more war will arise. This cycle will continue until only 2 tribes remain. These two tribes will be dominant in every regard leadership tactics dinosaurs and materials. Pitted against one another to see who will rule the server. You will fight your heart out against your former allies. You will destroy bases you'd once entered as a friend now as an enemy. You will kill dinos whose names you helped come up with. You and your tribemates will be cycling out who gets to sleep because the battle will last over 24 hours. The fight will go on and on and on and on with no end. It will be exhilerating.Then you win. Then you are the supreme ruler of the server. You are standing over the ruins of your former allies as you have proved yourself to be the mightiest. But then it will hit you. The sadness. As now all the people you had once known months ago when you were just a little tribe starting out will all be gone. Everyone you'd ever fought with and fought against are gone. While there is some joy in victory it is very bitter as there is no one left to share it with. Your tribemates will still play but it's not the same. Even if not in your tribe you had a community. Friends. Foes. Maybe even lovers. Now all that is gone. You will pass the ruins of these once great tribes and feel a hole in your heart. New people will always arrive to challenge you but you'll always beat them down. Destroying any hope they had. You'll build fortresses that'll reach the Heavens and have so many dinos it'll cause server lag. You'll build Great Walls across vast territories in order to denote your power. Finally you'll get bored and leave.Months will pass and one day you'll see Ark still in your library and hop back on. You'll log back into your old server. Everything is different. New names faces bases everything. Not a single structure you had built is left standing not a single ruin. All of it is gone. The people on this server see you log in and ask if you want to join their tribe saying that 'Ark can be harsh for noobs' but you could never tell them. You could never tell them an entire servers history. The hundreds of thousands of hours of work you'd seen put in by that ancient world. The structures they couldn't ever even imagine. The wars you'd fought and people you'd met. You could never explain to them what it all had meant to you for it is all now gone. In it's place is a new world completely distinct from the original while maintaining a strong similarity. You will be both extremely happy at this new world and profoundly sad about the world that was lost.Ark Survival Evolved will demand dozens of hours to just get the basics down and get priorities straight. To become a power on a server will take about a hundred hours. To conquer a server will take a couple hundred hours. To realize everything you lost and destroyed that you once held dear will take thousands of hours. To atone for everything you'd done to those you once called friends will take an eternity.If you'll pour time and effort no game will ever make you feel as strongly about the decisions you've made than Ark Survival Evolved. Beware that you may get addicted and lose your real social life and ambitions in exchange for this game. But you'll meet people you'd never have met otherwise see things you never thought possible commit acts that would make tyrants think you're true evil or saints believe you are the second coming of Jesus Christ. In the end you'll feel stronger emotions then any you've ever felt from playing a game.10/10 Masterpiece.,ARK: Survival Evolved
433061,2015-09-18,946,1383,426,True,Recommended,First review i wrote for a game but it had to be done!This game is like Crack! I've put a few hundred hours into this game and will probably put in a few hundred more. The devs are constantly pushing out new content (to a point where all the server maintenance is starting to become annoying haha) and they are very involved with the community trough reddit etc. Me and two friends of mine started off on a public server and had a really nice welcoming A nearby chinese tribe gave us some stuff to start out and we we're hooked to the game pretty much instantly. There were some big tribe wars going on on the server but we were left alone.A few weeks later. we have a huge metal base with a 5 high stone wall perimiter around it and 5 more people joined our tribe. All the big tribes but the chinese one left the server and got wiped out. And it seemed peaceful At this point we already spent hundreds of hours taming different dinos (which each have their different role like gathering resources carrying heavy loads transportation combat you name it) and we eventually also tamed a few t rexes and the stronger end game dino's. You name them all and because of their different tasks and stat builds you become sort of attached to your dino's as well which makes the game even better.One week later. Random (smaller tribes) are getting destroyed at night when they are offline. all the buildings blown open resources stolen and dinos killed. (take note some dinos can take over 10 hours to tame without kibble) At this point our base is more like a fortress we have over 70 organic turrets (think plants that split acid to hostiles) and 10 auto Gatlin turrets with loads of ammo in them. And an army of all kinds of dino's over 50 including 5 t rexes varying from lvl 150 200+ A fully metal layered base with different compartments with different resources in every room (makes it harder for raiders to get everything since they have to blow up more walls) The chinese tribe starts putting in random text in global chat in capital letters including our tribe name. they have always helped us out we have made multiple trades with them for resources and called them allies. The next day. I log on.Everything is gone.... all our dino's are dead every wall is blown up all our turrets taken out. and our base is in ruins. Hundreds of hours of building up Taming dino's training them taking them out on resource runs and working together with a tribe....gone....The chinese tribe who helped us out from day one Destroyed us.RIP.AtlasAbraxisNienTalonAeonMckittenMcCatMcMuffinMike the trikeBob the trikeArmageddonMorgothApocalypse AnkrahmunAnkaderpMuffinDeemDemonspawnSharkenatorLuluRammusRockeyStoneyScorpenatorMittenRappyOmegaMammutanWoollyMamenamenamenanCarnyBrontenatorAnd many more....That empty hollow feeling seeing your base in ruins and all your tamed fed and cared for dino's dead. I never had that before in a game.3 days later. we set up camp a few miles west from our old base. we had primitive tools and we were back to square one. But we we're determined and longing for revenge.... we broke down some old metal walls en made a small 4x4 room and set up the basic crafting stations. We had good contact with a few of the smaller tribes nearby who we helped out countless of times. now we needed their help. we secretly banded together against the Chinese tribe and they gave us some of the harder to obtain resources like crystal and oil.We started mass producing grenades.I went out at night with a stash of metal tools a crossbow arrows and food and approached their base. The chinese built a enormous stone castle on the water where they stored most of their Egg farm dino's in. I went to the beach. swam underneath the base. found a spot where i could hack away at their stone walls to get inside. Found a good spot and made a start. tribe members brought over grenades and we blew though the wall. Out came charging a T rex and 5 raptors at insane speed. we started backing off while firing at them. The water slowed them down. Called for the rest of the tribe to head over. we ended up fighting them on foot with primitive weapons. After a long fight we took them out one by one and eventually they all lay dead. That feeling of Vengeance is undescribable. but we weren't satisfied. We headed back into the dino pen and laid waste to their entire egg farm we killed over 20 Stego's three mammoths and a few ankylo's It was a massacre. Fueled by the loss of our pets and friends. Today we're still fighting a guerrilla style war against the Chinese. Constantly on the move hitting them where they expect it the least.Only a handfull of people remain on the server but we won't rest untill we have taken everything from them... like they did to so many others.Apoligies for the grammar mistakes etc. English is not my native language.,ARK: Survival Evolved

So here goes...I'm 32 years old. Been gaming since the Atari... been online since the early 90's. Done everything from chat based roleplay to full blown massive MMO's. I have a few hundred games on Steam and others on Origin GoG etc.Let me say that this is the FIRST time I have EVER seen a developer quite like this one.Make no mistake this is an Early Access title. So of course the launch was plagued with issues and the server numbers didn't cover the 100 000+ players... BUT the devs have made some of the most aggressive moves to resolve the issues that I've ever seen.In the first 24 hours of the game... we had over a dozen patches. In the first 48 hours... I can't even count how many. I recall yesterday having downloaded over 10 different patches through Steam. Seemed like one every hour. For me that's HUGE. A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product. You just don't see this type of response at all from an indie or AAA team.That said... the game is pretty fun and exciting. I'd describe it best as Rust with dinosaurs. Only the quality of the game is far superior being on the Unreal 4 engine. The fps numbers may be pretty low for most users but chock that up to poor optimization (which is expected of an Early Access title only a few days into release).In all you can't go wrong picking this title up at this point. Just make sure your system requirements meet the recommended and you should be fine.,ARK: Survival Evolved

But after playing this game for 8 9k hrs and willingly surviving all manner of bugs cheats and trolling I have found the 1 thing that I think is unnacceptable in any game which is the ability of other players to completely shut you out of the game. I am currently in someone's base cuffed to a bed being fed and watered and under ACs so I can't even play move kill myself or otherwise. Like I said I have a lot of hrs so pls don't explain to me how to kill myself in these situations assume I have tried it all. I am literally losing 0 food or water sitting here online for over a day now. I left my computer on to see what would happen and sure enough I'm still losing no stats because of this environment. Somehow my character has decided to also stop defecating so there is no way to die at all. I can't even be rescued/killed by my team because I am in a glitched location where the tribe has a giga parked inside biting through walls. While I feel someday the devs might actually listen and ban cheaters/make this form of prolongued capture bannable atm I am the tribe leader of a tribe that has no ability to play. I am not starting a fresh character and supporting a game that thinks this is gameplay. If you aren't actually playing it is not gameplay. I am sitting here not losing a single stat in a survival game FOR HOURS. Pls fix your game.

I tried everything that should help me according to internet and put all settings on the lowest possible so the graphics look like a game that was made in the nineties. And STILL my pc freezes for 5 to 10 seconds whenever I run or whenever there is a moving object (like a dinosaur) in front of me. Honestly I want my money back..,ARK: Survival Evolved
433083,2017-06-08,0,0,1751,True,Not Recommended,Really bad game.It is unfortunate as ARK had SO much potential when it began. The freedom to explore and build was fulfilling. Interaction with neighboring tribes was a social experiment. It was really fun to have long term goals to achieve difficult tasks through planning and to work as a team.Unfortunately Wildcard SUCKS with customer support. Any software requires a corrective actions process to fix bugs administer servers interact with the user group etc... Wildcard has poured all of their effort and resources into new models new skins new features and NOTHING into fixing glitches or exploits. They release game changing new models (tek) that WRECK the game... and provide almost no apologies or fixes. Every release seems to be in favor of the griefers and the exploiters who destroy the economic balance by duping glitching under the map using server lag to their advantage denial of service attacks etc... The ability to move resources across servers without first providing human referees and administrators MONITORING GAME PLAY was a STUPID idea. Providing tek transmitters that can be placed UNDER THE MAP with no server admins on duty 24/7 is completely irresponsible.Unlike other massively multiplayer online games (UO WOW EVE LOTR TF CS...) Wildcard slapped a beta label on a two year old game in order to bybass any responsibility of maintaining their servers. When you play the game you WILL be greifed by a cheater. There is NO recourse. Months of effort will vanish at 4 AM by a handful of cockroach players who spent a few hours grinding weapons that when combined with any of a hundred exploits will bypass your defenses. Your five generations of dino breeding will be wiped in minutes. 200 auto turrets on redundant power generators will be completely impotant as griefers slide into a map glitch and attack your base from underneath the map. They will bring a T rex from an unofficial server to an official server (dup exploit) during a major patch deployment with health 50x what is allowed... and wipe the dinos you took MONTHS to raise. You will watch your favorite dino fall through the map never to be seen again. Your best bird will die as your client lags out and fall to earth. There as SO MANY THING WRONG WITH THIS GAME.IF there was a full time admin present on each server that would respond to these problems and restore your hard work it would be an awesome game. BUT when you fill out a ticket with WildCard they will tell you that it is a beta and you are screwed. They have only rolled back servers when evidence of MASSIVE exploits are so painfully obvious they have to step in. Think about that their only recourse is to restore to a snapshot. That's it. They apparently have no parallel database tracking individual objects IN A TESTING ENVIRONMENT.Seriously don't waste your time. If ARK gets bought out by a larger more professional company (Blizzard EA)... then they will spend money on the support layer. But WildCard has proven to be completely incompetent in this area. Don't give them any more funding EVER.,ARK: Survival Evolved

433086,2017-05-19,0,0,2612,True,Not Recommended,"The premise of this game is amazing but the execution is absolutely embarrassing. Even for an early access game ARK is far too broken to be recommended to anyone. The balance issues are extremely prohibitive. Taming a dinosaur takes literal hours even for experienced players and most species are useless while some are far too overpowered. Once you have a base and some dinosaurs you can expect to have to log in at least every few days to keep your structures and animals from ""timing out"" and being deleted.There are bugs and glitches within every single mechanic of this game. I've had 30 dinos disappear at once. I've had many dinosaurs starve to death next to troughs full of food. I've had dinosaurs get stuck hundreds of feet in the air or get pushed below the terrain never to be seen again. I've had my character get stuck underground or in my own walls. The devs have claimed to fix all these bugs multiple times but they keep happening.And not suprisingly customer support is non existant. Lost dinos or your whole base to a known bug? Too bad. When not IF ARK destroys hours of your work don't expect anything more than a half arsed copy/paste ""sorry.""The developers of this game are far more interested in pushing unfinished and over priced expansion packs than they are in actually fixing anything in the core game. This is not worth your time or money now or possibly ever.",ARK: Survival Evolved
433087,2017-05-29,0,0,573,True,Not Recommended,This game started out pretty fun and has the potential to be. However what it has boiled down to are griefers running around destroying your bases and killing your dinos for lols. This wouldn't be an issue if it was more difficult to destroy something than it is to build it however it is so laughably easy to offline raid a base that there is no point in even attempting to build anything unless you are in a mega tribe with 20 players. Not to even mention that troll builds have players sprinting around at insane speeds with the ability to knock you out in one hit with a wooden club regardless of your armor. The community has just gotten more and more toxic since release.TLDR Game is full of griefers and promotes griefing by design. Stay away.,ARK: Survival Evolved

Solid gameplay in a fun environment.Cannot recommend however a lot of people have mentioned the high price and releasing DLC while still in alpha which is all bad practice the thing that has me not recommending this game is the many bugs and constant crashes combined with the 15min load times.

Its fun interesting massive tons of things you can do but the bugs are terrible when you run into them and unless you have a group of people you play with and only play this game it takes forever to get any progress. I probably would have ended up giving this a thumbs up but like so many others have pointed out paid DLC in early access. usually I could let this go but from what I've seen the DLC is more polished than the main game at this point that is a massive middle finger to the people who supported the game. Just a quick tip for the Devs perfect what you started before you perfect the side project.,ARK: Survival Evolved
433091,2017-08-29,0,0,222,False,Not Recommended,You won't see a lot of what the game proposes in their trailers and screenshots. I certainly didn't. It's a massive time sink because on standard servers it takes what feels like about 20 years to do anything. That's how I managed 222 hours. The Dev team has also made it clear that they do not give a damn about their player base. They only care about the money. Which brings me to another point the $60 price tag. I got it on sale and I felt like it was overpriced even at $30 during the Early Access days. Buggy as all hell with the original problems never actually getting resolved just content update after content update adding more and more to the problems already there. It's a shame that it's held down by these issues because the concept of the game is great. The biggest mechanic the taming of dinosaurs and other creatures is awesome. It's a shame that the rest of the game doesn't work half the time. Eventually it got to the point where I needed mods in a single player format for me to squeeze out any enjoyment out of this game. Oh and don't even think about trying to play this game without at LEAST a pretty good PC setup. Mine's OK and can barely pump out this game with decent settings but a fair few people will have trouble getting this game to run with even decent looking graphics let alone what the screenshots promise. Not worth $60.,ARK: Survival Evolved

Well you'd find that with this.However what you won't find with this game is good frame rate regardless with how low your resolution is. The optimization is horrid and rather than delivering a fix for it the developers have found that releasing DLC is more important.It's understandable that games will react that way if you have a poor PC and specs that are too fancy HOWEVER if you can run intensive games on Ultra such as Dishonored 2 Fallout 4 GTA V Middle Earth Arma 3 etc and NOT be able to run this game there is an ISSUE.Even tinkering with the settings setting them to medium or low and then flying away from any graphical clutters from dinosaurs spawned is not enough to keep the game's frames from being staggering then there's something in the game that needs fixing.But hey let's have some new DLC instead of optimization shall we?This is a wonderful game but I can not enjoy it because of the lack of work on it.,ARK: Survival Evolved

433109,2017-03-10,0,0,446,True,Not Recommended,"There are a great many options in the survival crafting genre. It's worth noting that most started at ARK and then fixed the glaring weaknesses. It's unforgiving in both good and lazy ways. Hostiles are... hostile. That's a great unapologetic quality. However it actively supports griefing in ways that are literally impossible to defend against. In virtually every official server all starting spawn locations are walled off and every inch prevented from building. This makes the server unplayable. Only recommended if you find an active server with a devoted admin as much game playability depends on them.Additionally there is no ""offline"" when you log in you'll usually find yourself long since dead and often with your base destroyed even on PVE servers. If you're into ""unforgiving"" and the concept that there really is no sense of safety that's a feature. If you prefer to be able to log off and breath a little easily it's a frustration. Years of work can be destroyed in a few minutes with no recourse.Pros Dinosaurs are cool. Seriously they're huge intimidating and amazing.Reasonably varied terrain.The ""polish"" is pretty... well... pretty. Dinosaurs really are epic from sight to sound. Water elements are very well done. Even on low settings the scenery and terrain are well rendered.There are seriously challenging ""end game"" targets.Cons No punishment or protection from grifeing. Most servers are unplayable for newbies within a day or two as all spawns are walled in and locked.No intelligent respawn. You can easily respawn in a base and be unable to even kill yourself to move out or die before you finish spawning in.Virtually all gameplay resolves to ""find dinosaur. tame dinosaur"" as you advance.Minimal weapon and armor choices. There really isn't specialization in skill advancement. All characters are the same.Servers are massively overburdened by controlling the hostile fauna. You'll get 15 second lag consistently and virtually all fights will involve animals warping around as you wonder where to swing at. Action resolution will take a very long time and you'll often find yourself warped back in time 30 seconds.A poor engine that doesn't gracefully resolve client/server position/action disputes an issue that's been solved since 1995.Comparisons Conan is a reskinned version of this with much better skill and item diversity but virtually no middle/end game hostile diversity.7 Days to Die is a much more varied survival horror crafting game with bases having more depth and modern weapons.

I payed a whopping 66$ for this game only to find it riddled with bugs and just general things that NEED to be fixed. &amp then I realize this is the full release and not even the alpha.. and I don't know how the dev's aren't completely embarassed of what has turned out. They took a great idea and butchered the execution in every way possible and now it seems as though they don't even give a about the game or the people who have overpayed for it.

433132,2017-09-16,1,4,90,False,Not Recommended,What is Ark Survival Evolved?Ark is a survival game set on an island inhabited by dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. And dodos.To survive on this Island you have to eat drink and build a shelter to withstand the cold of the night. Of course you also need weapons to defend yourself from the creatures of the Island and maybe even from other players.With nearly everything you do you get experience and levelups. With each level up you get a certain amount of skill points and engram points. With skill point you are able to increase your stats. With the engram points you are able to unlock newengrams (blueprints) to craft new items or objects. Another rather important thing is the possibility to tame the creatures. Therefore you need to get them unconscious and then feed them until the taming bar is filled. Depending on the type of food the bar feels faster but nevertheless it takes very long until it is completely filled. To ride the animal you also need a suitable saddle.The problemsEven though the may be fun to play there are way to many things that lower or even destroy the fun you could have with the game.The first thing are many bugs that occure and since the game is now released from Early Access im most certain those things wont be fixed.The next thing and probably the most important one is the performance. Since the beginning of the game in its Early Access phase the game suffered from a very poor performance. The developers promised ever since to improve it. Not only that they also promised to release a patch to support DirecX 12 which also should improve the performance. But till the present day the performance is still terrible and it seems like the plans for the DirecX 12 patch are comletely gone.The last thing I want to point out are the developers. Even though they knew of those problems they just made promises. They released a few patches which increased the performance. But not enough. They made patches which fixed some bugs. But not enough. They decided that it was more important to release content like new creatures or new objects to craft. And then they decided that it was more impoertant to use the money they got for finishing their game to make an expansion. An expansion which is not more than a new map with little changes to the gameplay.The conclusionArk Survival Evolved was a promising game at the beginning of its Early Access Phase. But as it went on the developers carried on to destroy it. And with the release of the expansion it was clear that the developers gave up on the game and just wanted to make money with it. And then they even decided to release it in its current state. I can't recommend this game and I honestly can't understand people who recommend it.,ARK: Survival Evolved

The official servers are impossible to play on.2. Private servers with friends are fun but there's so much grinding.3. Private servers on your own are boring because it's just grinding. 4. This might just be my PC but even at minimum graphics on a private solo server I get so much lag that last time I played it killed me. Right as I was getting on an icthy to run from a plesiosaur it dropped to 2 fps and I died after grinding for 5 hours to get scuba gear an icthy and a plesiosaur saddle and more that I had with me because it was all part of taming the plesiosaur. 5.

433137,2017-05-29,0,0,465,True,Not Recommended,"Graphics are great although very resource hungry. Building and exploring is fun but that's where it ends.This game demands the majority of your free time. You're not going to get anywhere with casual play. Being vulnerable when you're logged off is immersive but not realistic. Having to worry about losing your life and possessions while not playing it is unreasonable although an interesting tactic to force people to log on as much as possible. While I appreciate the challenging nature of Ark the comittment required is unrealistic for people who actually have a life outside gaming. Plan on spending many hours harvesting crafting and taming only to have everything you worked for taken away from you in an instant by a random dino or malicious player. Speaking of malicious players Ark is a classic social experiment to see what happens when people are without laws and morals. It runs parallel to the book ""Lord of the Flies"" or the TV Show ""Walking Dead"" where the worst side of people emerges when survival is at stake. You will likely be a victim of simulated harassment bullying terrorism and even slavery from other players. Sound fun?The concept of this game is an intriguing one.

I mean most dinos can survive ingame centuries without eating... WTF?! Resource farming ... you pickup a small stone about as big as your mouse +1 Stone.

I love the concept of what Ark is supposed to be I've dropped a lot of hours in the game for the short time it's been out and would do it again. This is where the but part comes in. I'm not going to completely pick this game apart because it's E.A. and I get that but it's going to be kinda close. There are a few things I want to see in this game before I go back to playing it.The Short verison welcome to Grinding Similator 2015 and Dino Prom date! ""she'll leave you when you go to the bathroom and never come back"" 2010/10 would play Destiny again because the grinding doesn't feel like you're getting dumped by the love of your life every time you play. Still love this game and will play again but right now we've agreed to take a break.The ranting truth long version.1) I want a Tribe alliance system like June 1st 2015. This way Tribe Chieftains meet accecept the pact and you have a better way of knowning who your are allies rather then ""Yeah sure we're friendly where is are you basesasuars?""2) The Griefing is a bit much. I've played 7 Days To Die and the PVP is real in that game. I've spawned in this and 7DTD and had to start over again. Now to be honest I'd rather start over on 7 Day's because I don't have to spend at least 6 hours just chopping wood to make a hut to live in. I wouldn't mind the grief so much if I didn't need to spend so much time rebuilding and getting back up and running. The other thing is this the defending of the base when you're offline is completely terrible. I have to hope my Dinos aren't aggro'd away from base a left in the wilds someone didn't stand on the back of a trike and shoot over the walls and killed them and finally the dinos decided to go on a camping trip and left base. Honestly building a base in this game right now is pointless either your dinos can't defend themselves and die or someone gets smart leads your 4 Rex's and everything else away from base and it's happy raiding. Right now I still haven't thought of a way to fix the issue without buffing the walls HP and resistances.3) Building is fun I like making forts and and learning from mistakes when my base is obliterated more then likely my fault I didn't think of something and that's why I'm spending 6 hours rebuilding a hut. The amount of materials needed to build a decent base in the world is insanely high compared to what you get out of it in return and takes about 10 minutes to go through if it's a wood base and you have a half decent trike. Now let me clear that up that's 10 minutes to completely level someones base. The snap system of building is Meh at best for example building on the side of a hill I put down the foundations just fine knew that have to switch to support beams and did. Now I have the base done and started putting up metal. Watch one side of wall completely fall off just cause and then could rebuild because the hole of open space was obstructed. So either tweak the building system or scrap it and start fresh because I spend more time building and when I'm not doing that I'm sitting down tamming a dino for 2 hours just to have it die in 2 minutes because I turned my back and a dilo spawned next to it and attacked taking the trike out in the wild to die by Shenainigains. The amount of resources needed to make walls and such should be reduced and I find grinding of Kertine/Chitin in game to be disturbing.4) Dinos are awesome when they are alive and so much fun the downside is they suffer from a mental handicap which makes tamming them practically useless to have around because once your base is rebuilt you're back to tamming your dinos which takes any where from 5 minutes for a Dodo to 5 hours of my real life to tame a T rex. Which honestly sitting there watching something raise it's head to eat for that long is stupid boring. I mean I could be rebuilding my base. The worst part of this is the fact you can aggro a horde of dinos away from base and they won't return to the last place they were told to not follow at. I've lost a lot of dinos that way for no reason. Simply add in to the commands to stay or return location with a 50ft radius of pursuit when attacked so they don't chase to the ends of the world.So now the good part. I like how the game looks the survival aspect is pretty much on point I like the current dino's so far though a huge beaver and bigfoot seem kind of lame additions. The crafting system is easy to get a hang of and the leveling is nice. Game is a lot of fun with friends and makes getting started only take 3 full days of your real life rather then almost a full week.",ARK: Survival Evolved

In short I like what I have played a fun survival game that has a lot going for it. After I had put more time into the game I fully planned to write a recommending review. However after the recent DLC announcement I can certainly not recommend the game. Removing Survival of the Fittest from free to play to a purchasable title is one thing but releasing DLC for a game that has not yet exited Early Access is laughable. The developers response was even worse citing that they had always planned to do this. If you want to test DLC and your game is in Early Access fine but it should be free.

Insanely immersion breaking.*Spawns are nonsensical. There are essentially spawn dots sprinkled throughout the game and a number or random dinos are drawn from a weighted list. That's it. There are no wandering herds. Predators don't travel the world hunting. Dinos don't travel looking or congregate at water or food sources. Zero immersion. Just spawn bubbles with random dino assignment.*Level requirements for everything. 90% of your time playing this game will be trying to think of a way to level up just so you can do what you actually felt like doing. Want to build a wooden base? Too bad you're not allowed to build a wooden floor despite having an entire forests worth of wood collected. Want to build a stone base. Too bad you have to know how to build a wood one first.... apparently being a stone mason requires extensive knowledge of woodworking. Totally makes sense. Why?

That is until the latest update... in the latest update tamed dinos were pretty much made useless taking away all those hours that I spent to get dinosaurs that I could have fun just relaxing and riding around. If you think ARK was a cruel mistress before I wouldn't even bother trying with her now after the dino nerf patch. Now if they do decide to fix this in the future then things will be back to normal and it may once again be worth all the time that many people invest into it.,ARK: Survival Evolved

433220,2017-11-18,3,14,1042,False,Not Recommended,ARK Is a great game. I like everyhting from the PVP aspect to the grinding and taming. But wiht the upcoming turret update i am NOT happy with. Because of this update my tribes huge base has to suffer where instead of having a couple thousand turrets and plant X we can only have 100 150. THIS WILL RUIN ARK AND MAKE IT UN BALANCED. PEOPLE WHO HAVE PLAYED FOR 2 WEEKS COULD RAID MEGA TRIBES THAT PLAYED FOR YEARS. THIS IS OUTRAGES!!!!!!!!!,ARK: Survival Evolved
433221,2015-06-03,1,11,127,True,Recommended,I have played for almost 10 hours upon release date. The game has problems yes the optomization is sorta bad it favors the higher end cards with higher settings giving more fps but lower settings less? Confused on that. The game closes and restarts as there is an update and the few hours I spent on a server is gone and I have to find another another downside. Servers go and new ones show up. Overall besides all the t the game is fun. Not what I expected exactly but it's more playable and enjoyable than rust or any other survival games. I would hold on to purchasing this and wait a week or two to see the changes. Game is fun guys and the people who don't like it are the ones who have no patience.,ARK: Survival Evolved

433223,2016-09-15,0,0,682,True,Not Recommended,LETS PUT ASIDE EVERYTHING YOU'VE HEARDI understand needing to wait until all the content is in the game before optimizing because new content can clash with the optimizations. (this fact seems to be lost on most of the community)I understand the devs need for funding after suffering the massive lawsuit. (another thing people dont seem to realize)I understand why the game is in early access it still has a lot of work and the devs want a live community to give feedback as it grows.However even with this all considered.. The truth is ARK has a lot of work and so far the way the development team has responded to the issues arising with the game and the wishes of the community has left a lot of the community unsatisfied. I reccomend waiting this game out see if the devs can better evaluate the situation and realize the right direction to take the game from here.,ARK: Survival Evolved
433224,2015-07-16,0,0,123,True,Not Recommended,UPDATE The game is still very buggy the lag is still present but at times worse as the server cant even keep 10 people on one server from having severe lag constantly then you have these idiots that go around and put pillars everywhere so that no one can find a spot to build the devs need to address this issue quickly the dinos arent running through my house anymore yet you start as a lvl 1 and will have lvl 116 birds come from the sky and attack up non stop at the early stages this being said the devs still have yet to address real issues they feel its more important to keep pushing out new content while they are turning a blind eye to the acts people are using to grief others to the point they cant even play the game also when they do updates that dont require client restarts if your on your flying mount you are automatically dismounted in air to fall to your death then you cant find your mounts anymore also in my case my first week back to try the game yet again i had to relocate my base 3 times because the devs kept changing the boundary lines for the updates they put out so in a short if you like the devs ing you up or like being griefed by other players in PVE not just PVP then this game is the bucket of youve been waiting for.Still would not recommend this to anyone at the current point In the games current state I would suggest that you hold off on your purchase of said product. The game is fun when playable. However there are alot of server issues with the game in its current state where the lag spikes can get you killed in more ways then one for example i was swimming the server hit a huge lag spike my character then was dead by the time the lag subsided from drowning another time i was out harvesting items to build my house when yet another lag spike reared up and i was attacking my a group of raptors and by time the spike went away yet again i was dead.Other game breaking issues that still havent been fix are the fact the dinos can kill you through walls inside your house when your not there then when you log in your house is not destroyed but youve been killed in my case this has happened 3 different times on one very fustrating occasion i logged in to being killed and having all of my items missing from my house even though my house was still intact so i was apparently killed through walls and the dinos destroyed all the items in my house not anyone else as this was a PVE server and not a PVP server. And today i logged into having been killed again by dinos but to top it off my home was filled with rocks to the point I couldnt enter or exit or get to my chests to create a item with which to break them with. Im tired of seeing these developers adding in new content while failing to prioritize the game killing bugs like the ones mentioned above. these devs are not addressing any of the major issues instead they keep pouring in more and more content ( which is good for a finished product) but in this case they are not holding themselves up to a level of detail that I myself would claim to be professional the content adding should be halted until they have the major issues fixed.If you dont care about losing hours of work or dying in your home from dinos that seem to be like casper the ghost and your not easily fustrated at things like that then this game maybe fun for you if your like me who has PTSD and gets upset because your dying from random things like server lag and dinos that go through walls then i suggest you save you money and spend it else where on a finished product that has good reviews.this game has good reviews but to many are fan boys who adobt games early and can find no flaws or just dont care that there money is spent on good quality products so as of now i cannot recommend this game knowning that is has major issues that alot of people are not addressing.,ARK: Survival Evolved
433225,2015-06-17,6,78,17,True,Not Recommended,In its current state my first hour was met with poor FPS on the lowest of settings Dinosaurs that glitched around when trying to fight them and then if I could manage to kill them the corpses had a habit of just soaring off into the sky.You start out naked without any clue of what to do I punched a dodo and lost health with every hit I punched it for meat losing health on every hit I punched a tree for wood to make an axe lost health doing so. Using your bare hands causes you to lose life while harvesting or fighting which is insanely stupid. I could understand after a few hits if you lost a little life for your hands being all bloody but still.At one point while chasing a floating corpse I fell into the rock texture and got stuck for a minute. After some jumping and trying to escape being stuck inside the rock texture I freed myself only to find my vigorous excercise left me starving and rapidly losing health because of it.The food bar depleats way way too quickly. I get its supposed to be survival and that running and such makes you hungrier than normal but not even one day/night cycle left me out of food multiple times.TL DR Looks great on epic settings optimization lacking.Buggy very buggy.,ARK: Survival Evolved

A really excellent sequel and you have proven that some companies can consistently produce excellent 40k games.,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2
433227,2019-01-24,1,159,9,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Engaging and accessibleBattlefleet Gothic Armada 2 is an RTS set in the Warhammer universe developed Tindalos Interactive a follow up to their 2016 game. While I have played several Warhammer games I m not very familiar with the lore or the stories so if you re curious about how it holds up in universe this isn t the right review to read. That being said I was impressed by how easy it was to get into the game but also how easy it was to get into the story. Positives The graphics are great but what s really impressive is the level of detail here. I ve been playing on medium settings and I was quite surprised to see the level of detail there is for the different ships. It s better than a lot of other RTS games I ve played. The battles look cool too they're fun to watch which is obviously quite important.One of my favorite parts of the game is you can pretty much choose for yourself how much you want to micromanage. If you want to you can just tell your ships where to move or what to attack and sit back and watch them occasionally clicking to activate an ability or something. But if you re a big RTS player and you like having a lot of control you can micromanage quite a few different things for each ship in your fleet. You can set the engagement range of your ship you can set which part of a ship you want your ship to target (targeting weapons lowers their firepower targeting engines lowers their manoeuvrability etc.) you can change the priority of a target which side you want to attack from and a couple of other things too. I ve pretty much stuck to just choosing which part of a ship to target and leave it at that but I like that there s so many options.The single player campaigns are quite engaging. At the time of writing this I haven t been able to play the Tyranid campaign (it wasn t available in the beta build) but the Necron and Imperium of Man campaigns are equally well made and engaging. The voice acting and writing is good and I like how the campaign maps work. I personally prefer the Necron campaign but that s just because their story interests me a little more and I prefer how their ships work.The campaign map is basically where you see what your goals are where your fleets and enemy fleets are and it s how you move your fleets to attack targets to take over systems. Your fleets have a set number of movement points that allow you to jump to systems connected to the one your fleet is currently in. My only complaint with the campaign map is that there are a few things that would really benefit from having tooltips that show up when you hover over them. For example systems have points of interest that can be upgraded. The problem is I can t tell you what the upgrades do because I don t know the game hasn t told me.Having three separate campaigns with three very different campaigns adds some great variety to the game. I was feeling frustrated with how I was doing in the Imperium campaign so I started the Necron campaign and was right back to enjoying it.In the campaign you earn renown for every battle you finish. This renown can be spent on adding new fleets unlocking new ship tonnages or on technologies that upgrade your stuff. I will say renown does seem to be earned quite slowly especially early on but I like this way of getting upgrades.I haven t played multiplayer but the balance in singleplayer seems pretty good. From what I ve played so far I haven t found anything that feels particularly over or underpowered even the small support ships are quite helpful. I also think the pace of the game is quite good especially as you can pause half speed double speed or triple speed. Also it s worth mentioning that you can issue orders while the game is paused (in singleplayer) I wasn t expecting to be able to it s nice to see.While the three campaigns are restricted to a specific faction there are nine more playable factions in the skirmish mode.There is an auto battle option if there s a fight you really don t want to do. Seeing as this is an RTS game I m not sure how many people are going to want to skip the whole fighting thing but it s nice to have it available anyway.Negatives The maps are a bit sparse. I mean I get that it s space but you re basically just in a chunk of skybox with a planet way off in the background. There are some things on the maps such as gas clouds and debris fields (you can hide your ships in these which is nice) but I just felt like the maps were missing something. I guess my issue is there s not much that differentiates the maps but maybe I m expecting too much from a game set in space.As I mentioned earlier there really need to be tooltips/more explanation for things. I m a few hours in at this point and there are still UI elements or parts of the campaign that I just don t understand. There s no ship customization here as far as I can tell. You do have quite a few options when building new ships (as long as you have a good enough shipyard) but you can t change what weapons a certain ship has. I wasn t too bothered by this personally but I feel others might take issue with it.There's really not much in the way of mission variety in the campaigns. So far every mission I've seen is either 'destroy the enemy fleet' or 'destroy the enemy fleet or reach the strategic point goal'. It needs some more mission types. Verdict While I have had a couple of issues with this game I m quite impressed by it overall and I ve been enjoying it more than I expected to. This is a great space/Warhammer RTS that has surprisingly good single player content. I think the price is pretty fair based on the content and polish here if you re a fan of RTS games or more generally space or Warhammer games I recon this is worth picking up.

433232,2019-02-03,5,72,40,False,Not Recommended,"I wish Steam has a ""meh"" opinion instead of just yes or no.Pros 1. Beautiful looking game. This has to be one if not the most beautiful 40K game out there. The devs put a lot of effort into making this game look like a movie. It is absolutely gorgeous.2. Wonderful storytelling. In fact this is the first and only 40K game set in the 8th Edition setting. Comes with 3 campaigns each with their own gameplay style and features. You get to meet important characters from the setting like Bobby G and and his aeldari whatever she is and some returning characters from Battlefleet Gothic Armada. 3. Good inheritance of the naval gameplay from Battlefleet Gothic Armada now with even more ships and factions! 12 different factions to play with (even though there are only 3 campaigns the devs said they are working on the fourth one). Now for the Cons 1. Campaign fleet management is based off of multiplayer balancing. It just doesn't make sense. In Battlefleet Gothic Armada you can customize each and every one of your ships giving it different skills and upgrades. Currently upgrades are based off of an upgrade tree and skills comes with the captain thus making the skills only available to the flagship and no longer customizable. I can understand putting upgrades in an upgrade tree I'd even say it is an improvement but I think the skills should be available2. QoL features needed Upgradable planets tracking invasion tracking and such features should be implemented. When you have 6 7 sectors in your hand and each of them has 2 3 invasions incoming it is very hard to keep track of everything.3. Bugs There are quite a few bugs in the game. Not quite gamebreaking but can be extremely annoying to find out for example the Archeo Gellar Field in Obsidian Depths doesn't stop invasions on Nemesis Tessera even if evolved to level 3 or playing a mission and suddenly finding missingstring texts or French out of the blue. These should be fixed ASAP.I would probably give it a 6/10 at its current stage add your own bonus points depending on how much you like 40K. Once some of the more glaring issues are fixed this will definitely go up.",Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2
433233,2019-01-26,6,202,88,False,Not Recommended,I'd like to be clear that this is a mixed review and I wish Steam had a mixed response button. The tactical ship to ship action is great and in a lot of ways better than the last game ships are tougher loadouts like torpedoes are effective but limited in uses and lighter ships like escorts are actually useful. I do wish they'd inlcuded more mission types but overall it's a big thumbs up.The strategic map is disappointing and it's disappointing mainly because it appears to have so much potential. The first game was a series of missions with filler coming from attacks on your territory this second game gives you a whole map to move around in ship yards to occupy defences to build and somehow feels exactly the same. To give some examples Occupation is always a simple matter of moving your fleets into the system and killing whatever is there. The AI can't do this and announces its rare intentions to attack your territory a turn beforehand so all your fleets can intercept them. Defences can be instantly built delaying the AI attack and making building any defences before an attack is coming pointless. The AI can't delay your attacks with defences but can limit your fleet size to two instead of three fleets seeing as there's a limit on how much you can deploy at once that makes virtually no difference. There's no way to delete an unwanted fleet and it will still cost upkeep. Because of fleet limits it's impossible for Necron fleets to recruit cruisers when they initially get access to cruisers.All this makes it feel like you're playing Windows Chess on beginner mode. What could be a meaty important part of the game is reduced to a series of admittedly fun tactical battles but they aren't enough to make the game feel solid on its own.The game is beautiful and sounds great the tearing metal of hull against hull and the flash of void shields being hit with macro weapons are enjoyable on their own.I hope this review is helpful. I'm certainly still going to play the game now and then and I'd hope some of these issues are solved in patches and expansions.,Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2

This is the new version which has microtransactions and less mod support at this time but also has an upgraded engine that can give more stable gameplay with some setups. I personally prefer the original game and see no real advantage to upgrading even though I was given a copy of special edition free when it launched. If you own neither of them you should do your own research to see if you really need or want to put up with the creation club and it's associated inconveniences to the actual modding community that has sustained this game for the last 4 years prior to making any purchase decision.

PROS The game is now in 64 bit which MAY improve performance and stability (NOTE no this doesn't mean that your crappy HP Compaq with 2 GB of RAM will run the game in Ultra settings) As advertised the graphics have been remastered featuring updated textures and new cinematic lighting effects such as ""God Rays"".CONS Significantly less mods available on the Nexus though popular mods are slowly moving into the Special Edition Nexus a lot of mods have been left behind in the old repository. Creation Club. As of December 2017 the price tag slapped on the game is ridiculous. Not worth it if you didn't receive this game for free. CREATION. CLUB.

This is just Bethesda trying to tempt you and when you fall for it you get a nice kick in the nutsack. Performance wise it really varies depending on your system but here's my conclusion if you own an older rig stick with the old Skyrim the 64 bit system will not help you. Otherwise get Skyrim SE you should notice an increase in performance and stability compared to the old Skyrim if you own a newer rig.Personally I'd stick with the old Skyrim ESPECIALLY if you don't really own a good gaming rig or want to extensively mod your game.

That would instantly bring this ""special edition"" to date and have it be special. If you're gonna update a game to the up to date times make it look it.

Pro's Better graphics Specificly blood water grass body and face textures look better than vanilla (its nothing compared to modded skyrim though) Better performance Its almost constantly at 60 fps only dropping between loading screens for a brief moment. No crashes lag freeze ups or major issues. Short loading screens I have experienced very short loading screens only times I get long loading screens is when I fast travel long distances and even then it is only 10 20 seconds. Fallout 4 save system Basicly we can make different characters and it automaticly switches saves makes it easy to make different characters without needing to worry about saves. Counts as a different game in your library from normal edition Basicly your saves mods and achievements and everything else is not shared between SE and normal edition so SE could be a clean slate if you have the old skyrim and broke it with too many mods. Cons Mods disable achievements Yeah Bethesda did it again. You can get a mod on the nexus to re enable them with mods but its worth mentioning. Not as many mods as skyrim This is the main downside to SE. For PC skyrim has far more mods than SE (but mod authors are working on making SE versions of their mods. Frostfall ordinator unofficial patches and others are already here and more are coming. People are having problems with the game. There are people that experience slow fps long loading screens frequent crashes and other issues. I have not had those issues but it is worth mentioning. So should you buy SE or regular? Do you have original skyrim for PC? Maybe not.Do you not have original skyrim or you're on console and you want the mods that SE will give you? YES go buy it. It is a great game especially with mods and mod authors are converting more and more mods from the old to the new. I've gotten plenty of hours already and I had over 700 on original skyrim!,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

So he bought me an XBox and game of my own. LOL When he moved over to PC for games so did I. I played Oblivion also. Loved it. Then when Skyrim came out on Steam he was sweet enough to purchase that for me too. The game is awesome in my opinion and I love the way the Special Edition looks. The graphics I believe. Looking forward to the next edition of Elder Scrolls.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition
433280,2016-12-20,12,439,475,False,Recommended,"Game was and still is so cool but what's more remarkable to me is how easy is to look for/install/use the mods this time.I usually play the standard mode sometimes due to my laziness but this game has quite a few excellent mods especially if you are looking for a nice immersion and realism a couple of things that you couldn't find at the original skyrim. This mixed with the new graphics from the special edition makes it SO enjoyable even when you role play warming up for 5 minutes next to a fire pit.Mods i use Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition this fixes most of the bugs of the game Campfire Lets you build a campfire and different sorts of tents Vivid weathers Over 500+ Weathers with different sounds and adjustable brightness shadows etc. Frostfall Depending on how difficult you want it you can even freeze to death and rain makes you be wet and get colder faster Wet and Cold Same thing but mostly for NPCs. Also includes some other features like blurry screen when you look up while it's rainning or snowing. Point the way Since i'm looking for some realism i avoid fast travelling this is why i got this mod which shows me the way to every city at every crossroad. Lampposts of Skrim Lamp posts on the main roads but just what is necessary not plenty of them. Waves Now beaches with waves D Better horses Now horses go faster than you by foot something that makes kind of sense. Less agressive animals Just makes less agressive small animals like rats or crabs. Was kind of ridiculous to see a crab trying to fight imperial soldiers. Hunter's Reward Better prices Able to skin and sell pelts for a reasonable price in case you wanna play as a hunter. iNeed To eat to drink and to Sleep is now necessary and rewardable. Holidays Skyrim has special days like our christmas and all that stuff Expanded Carriage Service Carriage service in places where you couldn't find them before like Morthal or Dawnstar. Rich merchants of Skyrim Merchants have more money to buy meaning that you don't need to walk around all skyrim to sell the stuff. (1000 septims was humiliating for a merchant TBH) Run for your lives When a dragon attacks people run off instead of trying to smack the dragon. When vampires attack Same with vampires The Paarthurnax Dilemma Lets you spare his life. Hold border banners Banners from different holds are placed on their borders pretty simple but cool enough for me. Immersive patrols SE Since there's a civil war going on it's weird not to see any battle along the way until you join one of the sides of the war. With this mod you can find these fights while you walk around. Make other kind of patrols available like the dawnguard. Practice Dummies You can use them to improve your skill till level 30 out of 100. That means that you don't need to deal with badass foes with the skill ""i barely know how to hold the sword"". Mammoth Pelts You can skin mammoths something that i still don't get why it wasn't allowed in the original game. Dog followers are Huskies Makes it cooler and makes sense too since Skyrim is the north. Whistle Lets you whistle to the horse to make him come over avoiding to search for the damn horse every time he flees from a battle. NPC's Run and Walk at your pace exactly what the mod says. Animal poverty Animals don't drop gold. Like they have a bank account or something... Immersive armors adds different kind of armors and shields. The more smithing perks you got the more armors will show up. (Showed in auxiliary armors) MamTuskPowderGrind You can grind mammoth tusk to make its powder an ingredient that was so hard to find and wasn't allowed (don't know why) to make it out from the normal tusks. Fantasy Soundtrack Project Replaces the original music OR adds its songs to the original music. Just necessary if after all these hundreds of hours you got tired of the original one. Enhaced blood textures MORE BLOOD! Skyland Landscape texture overhaul Static Mesh Improvement Mod Better textures for interiors. Skyrim better roads More and better textures for main roads. Verdant Better textures for grass. Blacksmith forge water fix se Makes the water from the blacksmith look real. Yeah... once you realize you need it. Realistic water two Improves A LOT water textures and effects. Open cities Skyrim No loading screen when you get into a city (this needs a patch to work with Ineed mod) Immersive Citizens their behaviour and dialogues are more real. (needs a patch to work with Open cities)BTW i got them in this order and all of them work properlySome of the mods are only available on nexusmods which leads me to my final advise Download the mod ""noble skyrim"". Improves SO MUCH the city textures and buildings. There's just one problem it has been ported to special edition but still remains on original skyrim from nexus http //www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45807/? There are two options wait till it's completely ported to SSE or download it manually from original skyrim and install it manually from Nexus Mod Manager as well. It won't show up on the list but it will be there so don't worry. There's a patch as well to work properly with SMIM mod (Static Meshes).EDIT I strongly recommend another mod that i just found out! it's called Amazing Follower Tweaks SSE and i found it on nexusmods. Short description you can have more than 1 follower (which is nice since Campfire mod adds tents up to 4 people) and it's possible to tweak each follower as you wish like creating different sets of outfits depending on if they are outside or inside a city setting primary spells weapons THEY CAN EVEN RIDE HORSES NOW!! and some other stuff.

And Bethesda should thank their lucky stars that people didn't give up on this parody of a parody of a game.Skyrim would have been dead on arrival if not for the modders' hard work and dedication. Over the years the modders have fixed the graphics sound engine added real physics HD textures made the world rich and beautiful interesting to live in and pleasant to look at. Improved and polished pretty much every aspect of the game. I have 90GBs of mods that I have to install every time I want to film stuff in game. Hey have you ever heard of Skyrim ? Oh the cockroach meme yeah!People call Skyrim a cockroach because it just won't die. Just when it seems that people are starting to forget about it Beth simply re realease Skyrim a couple more times Original Anthology Edition Legendary Edition Special Edition Switch Edition VR Edition all of them being the same exact game. No bug fixes same glitches same texture flickering and no improvements or any real effort put into it.Bethesda became a meme a laughing stock for any real developers out there who put love and effort into their games. Who actually test their games and play them themselves before releasing. Hell look at some of the games in Early Access on Steam. Those developers fix and patch bugs hours after they've been reported. But a massive tripple a behemoth like Bethesda ? Why bother ? Just re release the same game 5 years later. And of course everyone will buy it because they were foolish enough to think that Beth would have fixed all the bugs and glitches by then. They surely must have fixed Skyrim by now and probably gave it that awesome fantasy look right ?Nope! Skyrim Special Edition is a joke.They spent 5 years on ""improving"" and re releasing the same hot garbage. With their only real improvement being that the game is now ""more stable"". When it should have been stable right from the start like all the normal games are.The modders for the original Skyrim came up with much much better mods and fixes A WEEK after the game was released. A week! And that's people who do this leisurely for fun or out of the kindness of their souls. Original Skyrim with just one mod is ten times better than the unmodded Special Edition edition of the game. Which took them 5 years to ""remaster"".This sentence alone should help you realize what kind of company you're about to give your money to.Absolutely terrible. And Skyrim serves no other purpose than to be modded into a real game.That is the only reason it is still alive.Oh and Bethesda wants people to pay for mods made by other people to improve their game.

It amazes me that a team of modders created an ""Unofficial Patch"" that fixed most of Skyrim's problems but Bethesda didn't bother to fix the problems before releasing this ""Special Edition."" To be fair the lighting improvements are nice. Depth of Field and ""god rays""are now options. 64 bit allows for better framerates. Unfortunately we still have to dig around in the config files to adjust the field of view (FOV). One of Bethesda's unexpected new ""features"" is you can no longer get achievements if you use mods. Why would they do that? This can be bypassed with a mod but every time Skyrim releases a patch you have to wait for the mod to update. Speaking of mods some have been updated to this new version but mods that rely on SKSE's scripting functions will need to wait until it is updated.I do not recommend purchasing the Special Edition of Skyrim right now. If you got it for free great! A 64 bit executable and improved lighting is nice but it doesn't justify a $60 price tag.

However it should be noted that you may still experience poor performance in Oldrim depending on your Processor. Oldrim was designed and optimized for dual core processors and while there are some ini tweaks to make it somewhat better they don't actually do much. Basically the less powerful the first two cores of your processor are (such as with the i7 4790k which is what I have which sacrificed performance in the first two cores to have four equally functional cores) the more oldrim will chug at times particularly in areas densely packed with NPCs like Whiterun (top of the stairs there kills my framerate.)Skyrim SE does not have this problem as the updated version of the Creation Engine that it runs on is optimized for quad cores and beyond. This is the primary reason SE runs so much better on more recent systems.Still the MAIN reason to switch to SE is now obsolete. If you don't mind framerate drops in certain areas Oldrim just offers substantially more mod content...and you don't even have to get prodded with the creation club to experience it! Only go for SE if you really really prefer the smoother experience over the excess content...I mean to be fair it isn't like Skyrim vanilla isn't already loaded to the bloody brim with content and the amount of mods ported over grows by the day. In the time since I originally wrote this review SKSE64 has gone into a beta state and a lot of the ""essential"" mods for a good skyrim playthrough are slowly but surely becoming available to those who want the SE stability. ORIGINAL REVIEW I'm going to put this review up as a means to inform on a certain value belonging to this version of the game and not the t Creation Club nonsense. I do not support that idiotic service in any way shape or form but if you are one of the two people left in the first world who has not played Skyrim or you are using a newer built PC there's an element to the special edition you may want to consider.I recieved Skyrim Special Edition for free as did any previous owners of the original game + all of the DLC.For those who don't know Windows 8 and Windows 10 have a critical flaw in regards to Direct X9 which prevent them from utilizing more than a total 4gb of VRAM regardless of how much you actually have available for use. Guess what the original Skyrim was built atop?In otherwords unless you're still using Windows 7 odds are attempting to mod your classical Skyrim is going to be significantly more limiting than you may expect. 4GB of VRAM is just not a lot to go with when many of the most prominant visual mods expecially things like texture mods use very high resolution assets and that 4GB will be stretched extreme thin very very fast. Unfortunately the problem with DX9 is hardcoded into the newer varients of Windows itself and despite many the pleas from the community Microsoft seems more than happy to completely ignore it and leave it in place. In otherwords there is no way to remove the limiter and as such no way to get around the fact that some older games like Skyrim or DoW1 which run on DX9 will run objectively worse on NEWER computers than they would on older ones.The only real benefits to SE over the original Skyrim are because of this. SE has been completely converted over into DX11 and as a result the limiters do not apply. On top of that the game just runs flat out better and for what it is worth SE's graphical improvements over Vanilla are very noticable and quite well done. If you're the kind of person who likes visual mods but don't go deep into the side of things like ENBs the vanilla world visuals of SE may be more than enough for your tastes. On top of this SE is also notably more stable than the original which is to be expected.Unfortunately this comes with the caveat that many mods have not been properly ported into SE yet and also many mods flat out will not function with SE until SKSE64 the SKSE version being created for SE is complete.So pick your poison. You can get the original and be forced to severely limit your modding capabilities due to an obnoxious forced Vram limit coutesy of Microsoft or you can get the SE and not have to deal with such problems but have severely limited mod choices until an undisclosed period in the future where SKSE64 becomes available to the public.The point of this post is to inform people that yes there is indeed a logical reason for SE to exist. Unless Microsoft pulls their heads out of thier asses and removes the hard cap on DX9 the more time passes and the further away from 2011 we get the more and more unrealistic it is going to be to play a properly modded vanilla Skyrim.But if you DO choose to go with the CE I would advise two things Vote with your wallet go NOWHERE NEAR the Creation Club and it's disgusting practices. Do not even spend the free 100 points they give you to try it out. Tell Bethesda to sod off with their ""mini DLC totally not paid mods"" nonsense.And The Creation Club currently forces you to download 2GB worth of data essentially all of the mods that are currently available on it. If you do not buy literally every single mod on the platform that 2GB is dead weight on your hard drive and unless Bethesda swallows their pride and axes the service for the failure that it is that number is only going to go up.

433310,2016-10-29,0,0,161,False,Recommended,Product received for free. The new Skyrim Special Edition is a pretty clear difference between the original vanilla version of Skyrim. Mostly with how smoothly the game runs.Compared to the older version of Skyrim this now loads ultra fast. Running in 64 bit also gives the game much more stability.My break down for this is Pros Some improved graphics and tweaks to the environment. 64 bit (the BEST reason) Faster loading times and better stability. A future potential for better mods to be released. Free for PC users who had owned the entire set.Cons I personally think the improved graphics isn't really all that great but it's mostly because I have played the game with some nice HD mods and ENB enabled which makes this pale in comparison. To a vanilla player though this is a lot nicer. I just kind of feel like they could have done better... Especially with the character textures. No improved UI. This is perhaps the biggest con. The Mod Load order system within the game is quite clunky and has caused problems for me once.To anyone marking down this game because certain mods aren't released yet Um. You do realize that mods are made independently and not by Bethesda? Have some patience. P The SKSE team has released a statement saying that it will take a long time to release the new SE version. I've already seen some uploaders on the Nexus releasing a dull version of SkyUI so even if the author is MIA I'm sure someone will remake it when SKSE is released.For now there are a lot of mods up on the Nexus that you can use. Try them out if you'd like or wait until SKSE/SkyUI is released and enjoy replaying the vanilla. Cheers.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Big Skyrim fan since it came out but nonetheless nothing changed with the Special edition.To counter some of the so called positives in the game Graphics Graphics are better than vanilla but not in the slightest worth the 60 bucks they charge for it. Modders have already created a much more beautiful skyrim than this so called special edition. (Granted I got it for free but I'm talking about the whole picture here.) Optimization/Performance Let me start by giving you my specs gtx 1080 Oc'ed i5 4690k OC'ed 16gb ddr3 ram 144hz monitor (2560x1440). My main problem with the vanilla version is that (understandably) any refresh rate above 60hz wasn't supported (again understandable given at that time there wasn't much above 60hz). Now once I started up the SE it was still buggy like crazy not talking about water flickering buggy but talking about horse going batshit crazy buggy. Patches came out saying they made optimization fixes for the 144hz display which in my opinion didn't change anything. For some kind of reason I can't even play past 60fps anymore (Yes I disabled Vsync yes I changed the right Ini files yes I altered the nvidia cp yes I did everything I could think of and no I'm not new to this) conclusion still runs like crap (not so much like unplayable but more like the same crap the vanilla skyrim played at.) Sounds You all know the whole audio fiasco surrounding Skyrim SE I'm not even going any further into it. Patches/fixes Takes them months to come out with patches when they do come out they'll be vague like we are used to from Bethesda games. and won't really change the more important bugs or problems.Verdict Is it a fun game? Yes it's skyrim for me it was one of the best games there was until recently. Is it worth it's money today ? Not at all It is the same game as the one released in 2011. This is a blatant money grab not spending any time on the game but still raking in the cash. Keep in mind that this is coming from a huge Skyrim fan. I always wished that Bethesda wouldn't turn into what is becoming a trend among developpers but only time could prove that I was wrong If you can buy the vanilla version mod you game to the max and enjoy a truly special experience but don't encourage this kind of behavior from developpers.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Skyrim SE has finally broken that. This game is nothing short of useless. I can launch the game I can get anywhere between 5 and 15 minutes into it before it crashes and my computer reboots. Nothing I have attempted thus far has had any effect on fixing the game. If I paid money for this I would be furious. Lucky for me I got it free on release because I owned Skyrim Ledgendary Edition.

433348,2016-11-01,1,3,18,False,Recommended,"I hardly ran into any game breaking bugs back in the orignal skyrim with only one main quest bug occurring and another causing me unable to craft Stalhrim equipment. Other than that I faced very few issues and now that Special Edition has een released I am glad to say that I have yet to run into any problems with the new release. Colors look far more crisp with the extra additions being nice welcomes without the need of mods now. Some of these include rain not clipping through building structures to the addition of God Rays and improved textures. Weather effects have also been enchanced for a more visual appealing look as well. There are a couple of additional graphical tweaks that users can change as well such as depth of field. The new engine is now 64 bit and as a result is not subject to memory limitations faced by 32 bit. As a result my loads times are far more quicker with some being almost instantaneous. Since I received my copy for free due to the the upgrade promotion I find this to be a rather generous move by the company and one that broadens my hopes by what future mods can accomplish with the new engine. I never ecpected an updated version of skyrim as it was releeased not too long ago but this new updated released has me reliving the fun I had years ago. I never expected this to be a ""remaster"" in the sense of completely new assets because for the most part it was not needed. It is true that bugs have not been fixed from the previous 32 bit release but I have yet to encounter these throughout my playtime. If you own the older version and have nothing to gain from this updated version then it is not for you but if you do want some slightly updated visuals along with better performance then this is the definitive version to buy. Another possible flaw is that the audio has been compressed now however Bethesda has stated they are working to improve the audio once again on the pc version and mods also exist to put back the orignal uncompressed audio.

To summarize my experience with this game so far is that I am dissappointed with the mod aspect from without starting the game yet.

So free game is free and I like free. But after downloading it and setting up my graphic settings. I was curious on to mods. I was sadden when I saw that the steam community didn't have mods for the Special Edition. And Then things went downhill after that. I saw they had Bethesda.net and wanted you to log into there. So naturally I go to the site and try to create an account since I don't have one. Well it asked for a fairly simple request with usernames. But every username that is fairly unique to me was some how ""unavailable"" aka taken. I spent a solid 30 minutes trying to come up with any username before i just gave up on that notion. I seriously would say that if you are going to get this game for the modding community don't bother.

Note I got the free auto install since I had all of the DLC for the originalI don't really see the point except that Bethesda has realized that a year after Fallout IV (fairly typical timeframe for a new announcement or game release for Elder Scrolls) there is nothing going on. They want to try to build hype and make everyone dream of a new Elder Scrolls game.Well I'm still dreaming. This game looks much the same as the PC version I had before. I had a few mods (water updates fire textures yeah those bright glowing logs and some add ons) but nothing that greatly changed the visuals. They could at least have added some new content a quest series a new guild ride around in wagons ANYTHING. Now I have to go find new mods for everything (inventory window skills/leveling).I'm quite disappointed in the release.

I can't really complain since I got the Special Edition for free due to owning all the DLC for the original game but if I payed money for this hoping to get a modern looking game I would be very disappointed. They updated the ugly vanilla game from something muddy and low res to something slightly less muddy with a bit higher pixel count in their textures. Definitely still looks like a game that came out years ago. Beyond that I only just got to the character creation screen before I ran into a glitching guard that kept disappearing and reappearing every time he tried to walk through his horse while he was talking to me. So those bugs still exist too. Shadows are still overly dark and ruddy colors are still muted and nearly mono chrome. All around disappointing.Long story short the Special Edition is definitely not worth the $40 price tag. Go buy the GOTY edition of the original game if you really want to get into the series or at least wait until they drop the price on this.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

As someone who is an achievement hunter and to some extent wasting time on an open world Bethesda game despite my personal problems with it I still don't recommend to just about anyone from buying this game in the future.Because you'd be better off buying the legendary edition than the special edition (referred to as ""SE"" for my following review).Sure the SE's graphics are noted to be slightly better than vanilla Skyrim but only slightly.What's more is that the lightning effects are pretty much the only thing notable to be improved while say the graphics of NPCs indoor items they are all still the same with the only difference being done because of the lightning.This is not how you do remastered art.This is how you just plainly release the same product again with the same janky NPC animations that pretty much most if not all of them share the same voice actors only in a slightly more pretty looking sky.Gameplay wise it's the same open world rpg game though I admit that after playing the Witcher 3 it really feels awkward to return to a game like Skyrim and feeling less like I roleplay anything specific and more of the usual time when I just do whatever I want no reprecussions and just get all the loot and fortune.But the real problem with the SE the reason why I am not recommending this is because the game is awefully buggy. Honestly I'm tired of Bethesda getting away with bug ridden games because people think it's funny.Sure it is sometimes but then again some of these bugs do end up crashing the game or just make a quest plain unplayable because you were too curious to explore an area before the proper quest forcing you to figure out how to use whirlwind sprint shout while holding a wooden plate in the air just to clip through the castle's gates. Or in another case when you plain can't stop an NPC's aggro DESPITE HIM BEING ESSENTIAL AND IMMORTAL IN THE QUEST and end up just noclipping in an order to finish said quest!This is pretty much why I hate to see people still praising skyrim for what it does not deserve as this special edition is nothing more than a cash grab at a game that I mostly play now just so I can clear the achievements again and nothing else.

Graphics are not that better just some textures were changed to make characters more ""characters"". Game occlusion and ENB are ridiculous two vertical bars constantly on screen show a damaged/broken graphic setting somewhere Enhancements are minimal rocks or plants here and there minimal weather fixes and such. Basically looks like they have installed public mods on the Special Edition. Really? Public mods won't be supported anymore that is to say if you play with material from the Nexus you won't be able to save your game. But apparently Bethesda is working on a Mod System similar to Fallout 4. Game crashes here and there or just gets stuck on the main menu forcing a shut down.

The game was unlike anything I had ever played before and even after my Xbox was sold off for some cash I bought it on PC and started from scratch. I spent far far too much time on this game and frankly... this 'update' wasn't needed. The original to be fair has dated a little but not enough to warrant a remake. I honestly would've expected Morrowind or Oblivion to recieve the make over treatment (which they both definitely need because my god they look like trash compared to Skyrim). This Special Edition also doesn't really add anything that mods in the original couldn't of done except the graphics hike isn't optional and if you're playing on a sub par computer like me isn't good. At least with the original I can pick and choose my graphical mods to customise my experience sure it might look a bit worse than the Special Edition... but I can run it.All in all I feel like this was just to milk the popularity of a modern classic from the 12 hours I've played nothing but graphical stuff and a few little immersive things have been added. Again this is all stuff you can get in the original with mods. They should've only released this for console I feel and added more graphical options for PC rather than a new game that can't have it's graphics lowered.However I appreciate Bethesda for quite literally just giving me the Special Edition I feel like that was a great move on their part.

I have played Skyrim on 4 different computers over the years including with both an AMD 8350 and i5 4790 with the technically superior GPU being a 660 GTX. I always had lag.

I'm really looking forward to seeing how the game plays with a better GPU and some modding but it is nice not to be required to mod the game just to reach the quality level it is at currently.

433493,2016-11-12,0,0,63,False,Recommended,Product received for free. First off I'll acknowledge the hate around this game and even state why people aren't too happy with this game It's a repeat of the previous one only with a few things added/changed.What exactly was added? A new and improved 64 bit engine Sun rays Realistic rain (doesn't clip through rooftops) Realistic water movement (doesn't just flow in a generic direction)That's not a lot at all for a new game that (maybe) took them a few years to develop. I completely understand why a lot of people are outraged regarding this new game given it adds almost nothing new. No bugfixes textures are still horrible etc. I'm also at a loss for why Bethesda had so much time to enhance the game yet added mediocre things. I will however say that I enjoy this game way more than the previous one despite these mediocre additions.Why I enjoy SE more than its predecessorFirst off the original Skyrim's 32 bit engine is pettiful. I have a GTX 1080 and the game runs at a choppy 40fps average with no mods installed. It does get 60fps no problem but as soon as I enter Markath I get hit with fps lag. In the original Skyrim you can't spawn a lot of enemies too easily either. It crashes too much. In SE you can spawn 500 bandits no problem. If I do the aforementioned spawning my fps drops to about 15. That's a damn good thing btw. Sure some of the bandits fly into space but I can actually still play after that performance hit.Secondly the lighting rain and water overhaul looks brilliant. Just go look at the screenshots for SE (ignore the flying horse that's normal for a Bethesda game).Thirdly the game has a 64 bit engine. I know I (technically) mentioned this in the first pointer but this is about the modding side. So many people complain/boast that their modded Skyrim looks so much better than SE. Sure it does. It's damn logical it does. This game just came out and has almost no mods in comparison to the old Skyrim. I do understand why they do this though as Bethesda had so much time to work on a proper re texture that would look much better than any modder's re texture. Ever think of performance? Skyrim can be run on almost any system. I do not know of one person who can't run Skyrim on their laptop or even mac. Now imagine Bethesda re textured Skyrim with super high res textures. They'll lose maybe 12% of their audience. Wait a few months and the texture mods for SE will outperform any texture mods for Skyrim no problem (hense the 64 bit engine).Would I recommend this gameWell... Yes and No. Here's why Do you own Skyrim LE and have received this game for free? Click install already. It's a damn good improvement. Do you own Skyrim but do not own all the DLCs? 1) If you've recently played Skyrim and are unsure about SE don't get it. Simple as that. Wait a year or so and if you're still interested get it. 2) You haven't played Skyrim in quite some time and are unsure about SE get it if you can. It boasts way better performance than Skyrim (I get 60fps average everywhere I go no matter what I do). You do not own Skyrim at all and are unsure about which one to get Wait for SE to become more stable and get more mods then pick it up if you can.Final note I want to add People who are against SE merely for the mods in Skyrim being better... Stop it. Just... Stahp plz. Given SE's 64 bit engine I'm quite sure Skyrim's modding community might slowly deteriorate until there are no more mods at all. SE will be able to run so much more mods at a time and still have amazing performance. People will want to rather mod SE than Skyrim. Sure you'll still have support. But right now all eyes are on the SE side of modding.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

433509,2016-10-30,1,4,94,False,Recommended,Product received for free. My opinion of this game is a little wierd and I might get some hate for it but hear me out.Five years ago I bought this game for the 360 still new to the gaming world and at the time didn't even know Steam existed this was however not the first RPG I had played as in I had played Morrowind quite a bit as a kid. I stayed up for hours and hours playing the orginal release talked with my friends about it in my small town of &gt 5000 everyone I went to school with had atleast played the game. I played it for a good two years straight it was my go to game. After the first 2 years DLC came and went I got busy and play on and off till I eventually got rid of my 360 and then soon after move over to Steam and good ol PCMR.Within my first year of owning a PC for the intent of gaming I bought Skyrim at full price giddy with the knowledge of mods and console commands being able to fix those god forsaken bethesda bugs and adding new content to the game. I modded it a bit and after messing around with SKSE I got it to run. I think I played for a total of like 10 hours the orginal appeal of the game had been lost for some reason or another still not sure why if it was the controller being different the gameplay differences or the modding. Sometimes no amount of no amount of horse armor mods can save a game from just not being interesting anymore.When I found that I recieved this game for free because I owned the orginal and the DLC I thought it was kinda funny me and a friend joked about it even got this game for free and literally not sure who on PC would even ask for it. Yes it is a bone for the console community this game was probably released to Steam because they didn't want any hardcore PCMR bros getting off and ranting about console exclusives. I literally installed this game as a joke knowing that mods didn't work on SPE and how much I didn't enjoy the game on PC before.This game made me want to play Skyrim again the fact that you couldn't mod it felt like a more pure experience kinda like you're forced to play a game the way it is a feeling I had forgotten about since moving to PC. I never had many problems with the vanilla game on 360 and I felt more like I was playing a remaster of a console game than a true PC game which yes I know I said that it is a console game more than a PC game. This game really and honestly did not need to be released for Steam the graphic update is from the free dlc they made for Steam back a couple years ago. This game in a sense took me back as in the dreaded word of all reviews and opinions that completely and I mean this non sarcastically ruin it.Nostalgia. This game gave me hardcore nostalgia to the days of being a kid in high school dealing with homework and trying to impress girls the nights of staying in the living room all night eating junk food and playing a video game in the dark wrapped in a blanket. The weekends of friends coming over and taking turns playing a single player game rather than a multiplayer game because of how much fun we were having with it. Those hours and hours of looking up cool items in the game and where the best loot is and what cool stuff we could do with our characters. This game gave me the feels reminding me of friends I had lost to the tide of time all the time I had bleed into this game before I knew the horrors of the video game industry and the curse of DLCs and microtransactions. Let me make this clear this very important fact of what I'm saying.Nostalgia is a .Nostalgia 100% ruins the legitimacy of my review and my opinion of this game. It is not a solid ground to stand on when stating anything I know this and everyone reading my review should know this. A game is not good because it gives you nostalgia you should judge a game solely based on it as a game and so I will. This game is fun has a lot of stuff to do and in a very sarcastic sense has everything you enjoyed from Skyrim Orginal. This is just a update to the graphics and engine as so I heard. I've gotten my fair share of glitches crashes bugs getting stuck in objects and graphics going to because of draw distance. Seriously though this game has had no updating other than graphics and engine. That exploit you could do 5 years ago? Yeah its still there you can do all the old exploits and glitches bugs haven't been fixed and nothing is patched. Bethesda is just another triple A or AAA gaming studio that wants money cash cheddar caps and septims. I would say no new bugs but I've gotten stuck in objects a lot more than I remember. Would I say get this game for 40$? No lol if you got it for free thats great but if you want this exact game with mod support just buy the orginal with DLC during a good sale. I personally enjoy this game as it is and I have no desire to mod it in any way. This game gave me the feels and the dreaded N word of opinions. Uh the Nol starting word of opinions. Game has me in a good mood to play RPGs even got me to play some more Fo4. Just to make the record clear I have no positive opinions of Bethesda solely playing their games because I enjoy the game.So get the game if you want to play some vanilla Skyrim if not than buy the orginal release for mod support or just play a RPG thats not Bethesda heard they're pretty good.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

It's a port!"" This is true... but they've advertised it as a remake emphasizing GRAPHICS in order to make their sales. People have argued that nobody should buy this for graphics and they're right if you own this for PC there's absolutely no reason to purchase this again if you didn't obtain it for free. The fact of the matter is even if it is only a port it wasn't advertised that way. Technically that's false advertising.Skyrim is an extraordinary game. Even if its lore has been dumbed down compared to previous Elder Scrolls titles. However the Special Edition isn't worth $40. Not unless you don't already own it. The visuals are improved minorly with a few details like better shaders lighting and environmental effects like fog. It does run a little smoother but no previous game bugs are fixed which certainly proves ones point that it's merely a port. My biggest complaint is as mentioned before it's advertisement as something more. The Special Edition changes virtually nothing graphics wise and literally nothing in terms of gameplay. You'll be sorely disappointed if you're purchasing this because ""gwaphix!"" or are expecting some form of new content. There is none.This is a money grab. But not necessarily for PC gamers. Bethesda has given us the liberty of obtaining it for free if we've owned the previous edition before a certain date. That's all fine and dandy but the point of this re release was to obtain some revenue from console gamers. I definitely cannot complain it was free since I've owned a copy of Skyrim already on the PC. But everyone seems to miss the point that it IS port meant to improve gameplay for CONSOLE gamers to get MONEY from them. Not from us. If you don't already own Skyrim then perhaps the $40 price tag isn't a big deal. I would personally wait for a sale if I didn't already own it but that's just me.To conclude Skyrim Special Edition does NOT add anything new. My negative recommendation comes solely from the fact that I know people are only looking to buy it because they're expecting ""new new new!"" it's just Skyrim wiped over with a lavender scented wash cloth.EDIT Bethesda's mod browser is also absolute Steam Workshop was a far better and more convenient option and it was actually reliable. For those of you who didn't heed my warning and bought the game only to be disappointed by Bethesda's mod browser just find a tuturial on Nexus Mods. It's a lot easier than you think and beats the hell out of whatever Bethesda was trying to pull.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

God rays and rain occlusion are a very nice touch. A+2. Enhanced clothing textures are noticeable but things like quivers still don't close up to the body. 3. 64 bit. This is what will keep the game running for the next decade or two THIS is the core reason to have this version. 4. Lots of same bugs as before some new ones too. I don't get this part at all. and it's just sloppy. Mods fix this google ""unofficial skyrim patch"". I expected to not see wolves falling from the sky.5. Audio files have been downgraded but not overly noticeable for me with current headphones. Please release original or actual remastered audio files please.6. I noticed a significantly improved load time. That's a nice plus.7. Viewing distances seem much improved with much less graphical hit than in the past. Could just be me. 8. Alt tabbing no longer crashes the game or mucks it up. Alt tab first try goes to black screen second try (hold alt tab) allows me to navigate. Improvement I guess.If you own a previous version but weren't eligible to get the remaster for free don't bother. Hold off til it's cheaper and fixed. If you have the ability to download this free go for it. Just be warned that it will likely be a downgrade with stock settings versus your old modded version. Give it til 2017 for a full modding experience to come to fruition. I got Skyrim Collector's Edition day 1 at midnight and I've spent more hours in this series than I'd like to admit. Having said that it appears to be a cash grab for the console peeps. At least it's 64 bit. I'll let the modding community fix what Besthesda won't do.All settings to max.

Sure it's still good old Skyrim including all of its previously released DLC from 2011 but (slightly) graphically updated... However you could achieve much better looking graphics out of the original Skyrim with mods. Sure you could get mods for Skyrim Special Edition... but you need some sort of Bethesda account whereas in the original you had the Steam Workshop by your side!Oh and yes this is a Bethesda game so don't expect them to have bug tested this game before release. There are a fair few new bugs. For example in the opening cutscene before you create your character Lokir the guy who gets shot trying to run away cries ""NOE! AM NOT A REBOL. YOU CAHNT DO THIS D &lt "" as per usual but after that nothing happened. He just stood there and the guards stared at him in silence. I had to start a new game to fix this bug. An assortment of old bugs carried over from the original too.Actually all of the bad from the original carried over to this edition.

The game assets are virtually identical to the original's HD textures. The updated game engine does allow for some added effects which can be really nice but they can also contribute to a ""polished turd"" look generally. It's a mixed bag.2) Sound. The Special Edition sounds like garbage compared to the original release. The existing uncompressed audio assets have been mangled under an ""updated"" encoding scheme here and the results are pretty bad. It's a shame particularly given how rich and immersive the original sound design was.3) Mods. The Special Edition jettisons the Steam Workshop in favor of Bethesda's own mod host. It's pretty obvious that Bethesda is just waiting to pull the trigger on paid mods again it's only a matter of time. It seems that the Nexus is still a viable modding option though. Regardless by the time Special Edition compatible mods reach any sort of maturity you'll undoubtedly be able to catch this game on a sale anyway.So yeah for a $40 asking price this ""Special"" release just doesn't quite cut the proverbial mustard.

The bugs in this border on gamebreaking. Somehow this remaster takes all the bugs that existed with the original game and has made them worse. I'm constantly looking up console commands to attempt to fix issues in the game. I can't use any ability that slows time as it ends up staying slowed permanently (Kinda neat for 5 seconds then really annoying) The combat music loops without end after you have finished a fight. I actually had to turn off the in game music because it was driving me insane. I've gotten stuck in the ground more times than I can count with no explanation as to why forcing me to noclip out. This is just a handful of the issues I've had without getting into the silly stuff like NPC's walking away from you during dialogue breaking quests shouts not working (Always fun to line up the perfect shout just to have it decide it doesn't want to work this time) and just overall shoddy programming for a full price game. The worst part is I barely have over 20 hours playtime and have this many RECURRING issues. These aren't just one off bugs they happen over and over consistently.

But if you dont have it you have to pay $40 for a game which has 5% of the community content that the base game has which in my opinion is what drives its huge replayability. Not only that but the games graphical improvement is barely noticeable and somehow it can be improved beyond what it is simply by mods in the old verson.I just can't think of any reason you would spend your money on this. There is nothing here that is worth your money. At all.Oh but that is not even CLOSE to the worst of it! I will be running down that list.1 They had the dignity to hide the standard version from the steam store so you can't even find it without a search on google. It is like they are refusing to acknowlege its existence.2 Lack of any real changes to the game at all. I challenge you to find a significant one which effects it in a positive and noticeable light to the average player.3 Creation Club. What else is there to say? It is restrictive glorified anti consumer microtransactions in a 5 year old $40 single player rpg. Some of which can even be found already for free and one of which should be in the base game to begin with.In summary this is the worst ""remaster"" I have ever seen. Go buy the old version instead don't spend your money on this greedy valueless trash. And most of all we need to stop the creation club before it gets out of control.

By the time I'm writing this I haven't even finished installing the game but based what I've seen on other reviews and media around Bethesda is that the original Skyrim is hidden in Steam. You can still buy it but you cannot find the game if you try and look it up in the search bar. On top of that there's all that jazz with the creation club basically being paid mods.Also apparently there are a lot less available free mods for this version of Skyrim compared to the original. The game is also known to spazz out when going over 60 FPS. This becomes a problem for owners of 144Hz monitors. The ridiculous mouse acceleration has to be turned off from the .ini files and there's no option for changing your field of view in game either.Thanks for giving me an opportunity to leave a negative review for free Bethesda.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

433629,2017-08-26,0,0,84,False,Recommended,The Elder Scrolls Skyrim what a way to continue after the amazing predecessor TES Oblivion. Skyrim has been an absolutely amazing title since is release in 2011. Again this game wasn't &amp still isn't perfect (Obviously because its from Bethesda D). I have spent a decent 1100 hours in Skyrim across PC Xbox 360 PS3 &amp PS4. Lets just say I am kind of a fan ) This game offers an experience that barely any other games can compare to. The map is quite large containing many areas to explore with a vast number of unique experiences in each one. Yes after your 100th dungeon you may start to get a bit bored because of repetetiveness but thats nothing that mods cannot fix.Playing the game for its first time will be a bit slow due to the inventory system &amp questline sometimes being a pain in the backside. It doesn't really matter in the end you'll quickly fall in love with the game despite the not so rare crashes that will occur (Thanks Bethesda). The main story will keep you occupied for well over 15 hours on your first playthrough but thats not it! The amount of guilds (Mages Thieves &amp Dark Brotherhood) offer a highly diverse questline that you'll never forget.FAQ Q Is this game good?A Dumb question just buy it and enjoy it like so many have since 2011!Q What do I do once I complete the main story?A You play the DLC's (Which are great btw) and complete the guilds &amp faction quests. Q What do I do after completeing most quests &amp areas?A Either quit (Lose out on so much) or you can hop on over to the modding community. The modding site called the 'Nexus' &amp the integrated modding system from Bethesda will easily get you well over the 100 hours mark.Q Why would I mod is it hard to do so?A Modding can be very simple by using the In game one or slighly harder with the Nexus one (Tutorials on youtube around 5 minutes long). So the reason for modding is simply that it adds an infinite amount of content. There are some absolutely amazing content creators out there that have amazing DLC sized mods which are FREE! Want new enemies FREE! Want new lands to travel to FREE! Want to turn Skyrim into a tropical paradise FREE!Lets be honest here everyone has Skyrim or has at least heard of it. If you're still hesitating after all this time just grab it on one of the sales for so cheap. Remember there is a refund button which you won't use it anyway ) Hope on over into this amazing installment in The Elder Scrolls series and explore Skyrim!,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

433643,2017-01-15,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. Got this game free because I already had Skyrim. Spent only a few minutes in this game comparing with the original. My personal verdict is that if you don't already own Skyrim there's no major reason to not get Special Edition instead of the original. But if you have the original you might as well stick to it with the official high def texture pack and a couple water mods maybe a saturation mod and a shadow banding fix mod if you want to go all out. Which chances are you already have installed.It doesn't look much different and what few differences exist I personally did not like or didn't think were worth dealing with the couple changes I didn't like.Also speaking of mods if you want to use mods on Special Edition it apparently disables achievements. You also apparently have to create a Bethesda account or somesuch in order to use mods. I didn't look too closely into it so maybe it's not a requirement if you work around it. But it's worth knowing.I copy pasted a save file from regular skyrim into special edition and took a couple comparison screen shots. Below I will link the original version screenshots in their descriptions they have links to the corresponding special edition screenshots.http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 843562083http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 843561842http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 843561682http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 843561511Something I noticed that I didn't see in other reviews not that I looked too closely at them was that in special edition the camera is weirdly ""zoomed in"" in first person mode. Like it's as if the camera is a foot and a half farther in front of your face in special edition than it was in the original. It's very disorienting I kept feeling like I was going to smack my face into something or Serana would pop up and be RIGHT IN MY FACE.It is of course up to you to decide which version you like better. I and a couple friends I showed these screenshots to preferred the original. But if you own the original and are wondering whether to bother installing the special edition.... Nah I wouldn't recommend it.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

433648,2016-12-02,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I wish there was a neutral option for reviewing. I love Skyrim but this just doesn't warrant enough for a purchase and that's what my review is for. If you already own the game + DLCs then you have the game so no ned to worry. But when it comes to people who are looking to get into Skyrim for the first time I'd say wait a bit till the mods really start pourin in or for a sale.Right now the same bugs are still in the game so Bethesda still expects us to fix it. The textures are the same the only real difference is lighting effects some more flora and water textures. However the 64 bit boost is a huuuuge thing for mods but right now it doesn't mean anything since SKSE doesn't work yet.Anyway I'll change this when this game is actually worth its price. I recommend if you're a noob just get the original and soup it up with mods and you'll be fine.UPDATE Paid mods have come to skyrim and they hid the original.

Hate me all you want but i'm disappointed. They could've made everyone happy by remastering one of the old games the core of TES. Hell I'd buy a 40$ dollar Remastered Morrowind. But instead they decided to take Skyrim slap a new label on it ruin the mod aspect of it and sell it as a new game. Sure they gave it free to PC users who previously owned Skyrim and all its DLCs but even then its preferable to play the original. At least then you can still play with mods AND achievements.It's my opinion but sadly the majority of you will probably demonize me without thinking for a second. smhThis vine right here sums up my thoughts on Skyrim Special Editionhttps //vine.co/v/MgvLUZu5t7W,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

433681,2018-05-17,1,8,15,False,Not Recommended,Writing a negative review for one simple reason. This game has been out for a very long time it has been patched and fixed for years AND it has been re released with so many different PAID versions that by now it should be fully functional.I however experience a nearly game breaking bug that no one including google searches were able to actually resolve. Conjuration spells completely stopped working for me.Every single attempt to fix including removing shrines buffs magic resist you name it failed to fix the problem. People reported that cast speed could break the game and in some cases your save file could become completely corrupted which would also break the game.However you want to spin it I'm not OK with a 100% vanilla zero mod play of this game being broken to the point that I cannot cast spells from an entire school of magic. Other spells (including self buffs) worked fine but Conjuration would not after about level 17.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I love this game but ...When you don't already own this game and you are thinking about purchasing it I can't recommend special edition due to workshop. Imagine two exactly same games one of which has steam workshop enabled and second got obstacles for mods like registration on bethesda and downloading mods externaly. Where is comfort in that? I need the game to be costumer friendly and bend to my needs. This is the reason I chose to recommend the old legendary edition of skyrim over this special edition.

Bethesda really delivered what they promised. The softer aesthetics and new lighting and effects are phenomenal along with updated textures makes the game unbelievably beautiful. The fact that it is true 64 bit makes the game run very smoothly and load times are extremely quick for me. I've also noticed plenty of new dialogue throughout multiple quest lines. It saddens me to see this revamped Skyrim get such a bad rap for all the wrong reasons and from people who don't pay attention to all the little beautiful details added to the game. I will be playing this version of Skyrim for quite sometime and hope new and old players aren't swayed from playing an even more exciting and optimized version of Skyrim!,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition
433689,2017-06-14,0,0,38,False,Recommended,Skyrim is a massive open world action RPG with an open ended skill and progression system that adapts to and rewards your playstyle. Quests never feel like hum drum fetch quests and apart from the main questline even the sidequests themselves encapsulate stories within stories.SE also features 64 bit enhanced memory support and a plethora of visual upgrades that make the world sharper the shadows more shadowy and the sunrises well...more sunrisey.As a bonus it also fixes the game's previous alt tabbing problems.I've previously put hundreds of hours into the original console release before purchasing it on the PC as well.After purchasing it on PC I was pleasantly surprised when it was later announced that previous legendary edition owners would get SE for free as well...despite people claiming how greedy Bethesda is.Creation Club Bethesda recently announced (June 2017) that they would be releasing a curated content marketplace at E3. This caused an uproar on the Steam forums (for whatever that's worth) in large part due to the fiasco that was the previous workshop store on Steam which was widely panned.You can read about it here https //creationclub.bethesda.net/enThis led to many people mass downvoting the game and downvoting any positive reviews in protest as well as flamewars in the forums.Many of these negative claims are based on hyperbole and misinformation from people who haven't read the official FAQ and have made a lot of assumptions and rumors and then got outraged about the rumors that they made up. There has been some intelligent discussion on the subject in the Skyrim Steam forums but it was mostly drowned out.You can still purchase the original Skyrim on Steam.http //store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/SE doesn't require you to use its built in mod manager nor does it force you to buy content from Bethesda only. NexusMods has over 6000 mods that support SE.If you read the Creation Club faq Bethesda also states they will continue to support the free and open modding community.Content creators will be screened by Bethesda and have to show examples of their work before being accepted to the program and all content will go through an approval process and development pipeline so the kid that tried to sell $99 horse genitals on the old workshop store isn't going to cut it here.If you were following this drama you should also know that the mudcrab armor for Skyrim and the horse armor for FO4 were inside jokes based on old memes. Apparently a lot of people didn't get them and took them 100% seriously.Bethesda has also stated that they will not be accepting pre existing mods for the creator program and they will be releasing new and original content.If you don't like content marketplaces that allow users to submit content and if approved get a share of the sales then you shouldn't support CSGO TF2 Dota 2 and many other games on Steam. This isn't the first single player game to sell content like skins either. In fact this also describes how the Steam store works too. Publishers and developers submit their content Steam sells it and takes a cut of all their sales.Now if you just don't like the idea then there's nothing wrong with that. But there are/were many users on the Steam forums shouting profanities slurs bigotry telling people to themselves talking about murdering the developers and claiming that anyone who doesn't agree with them is being paid by Bethesda.

Don't bother modded Legendary Edition is just fine.Two hours is enough to remind me why I hated Vanilla Skyrim so much. The best game to play right now is the waiting game as we wait for the modders to port their mods over to this so called ""Special Edition"". If you played Skyrim on consoles or you don't care about mods at all then yes I recommend this game. It's not that Skyrim on release date was a terrible game. It deserved all the praise it received back in the day. But after several hundred hours of playing modded Skyrim the shocking reduction in quality playing Special Edition with no mods is jarring. Yes the graphics are better and because of this many HD mods become redundant which can help save hard drive space for those with only mid range PCs like myself. But how good are the remastered graphics? Sadly not very. Here's an excellent example at how lazy Bethesda is at remastering graphics. http //www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659/? This mod shows in detail how low res the textures and meshes are even in this Special Edition. Now I know what you are saying ""Well of course mods are going to be better than vanilla that's the point of modding."" I hear what you are saying but consider the following. Bethesda is a huge developer/publisher with millions of dollars hundreds of staff and had months to work on this remastered project. This author worked alone and released the original version for vanilla Skyrim exactly three months after its release date. All the author needed to do was port over all the assets he already had for vanilla Skyrim and Bob's your uncle. Why didn't Bethesda take the time to give this Special Edition the love and care it deserves? Answer because they don't give a they just want your money so they take the game make it 64 bit slap some god rays on it and call it a new game. Also the lack of improvement was that the game could still run on consoles. When are companies going to stop treating PC players like second class citizens when they have far more money than console players on average? My PC was relatively cheap at about $1300 CDN. A PS4 can be purchased for $450 CDN brand new. A $1300 PC and a $450 console are never going to be equal. PC is always going to be the most powerful gaming platform. Deal with it stop pretending and stopping screwing over the customer base with the most amount of money. Even someone working a minimum wage job full time can save up to buy a console in as little as couple of weeks depending on how badly they want it. Don't fall for their nonsense. I got this game for free from owning Legendary Edition and I still don't recommend it. If you've never owned Skyrim before buy the original Legendary Edition and just add mods. The modding community has not abandoned vanilla Skyrim and is unlikely to for a very long time if ever considering that mods for Oblivion and Fallout 3 are still being released.To sum up as a remastered edition I am not impressed. Vanilla Skyrim was an awesome game modded Skyrim is even more so. This version? Just no don't bother. Don't reward greed and laziness by paying money for this game and if you got it for free don't rush to download it as the best mods on Nexus are going to be weeks and months away from Special Edition compatibility. Let's face it nobody buys Bethesda games for their vanilla content they buy it so they can mod the hell out of it and make a better game. Hell the whole point of this release on console was to add mod support. Even Bethesda knows modders make a better product than they do. Again do not reward this behaviour by spending money on this product or they will keep doing the same ad nauseum.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Then bethesda announces their biggest project to date SKYRIM SPECIAL EDITION the thing they have been spending all your time and money on. But what innovations does this game have? the water is 4k and it gives you all the dlc. That would be fine and dandy if not for it being unable to share the originals skyrims mods which was the main reason people even liked the original skyrim because it had so many issues. This was a big rant but buy the original if you actually want the game even if it costs more. I for one do not support this game even though i unfortunately had the displeasure of buying it on sale.Overall not worth it.

I'm going to assume that most of the graphical upgrades were due to Fallout 4's development since they are the same engine. The same bugs exist once they stopped patching Skyrim but what's funny is the audio is worse quality than the original's. And there is nothing new nothing that really makes this edition special other than its 64 bit.A lot of the best mods need Skyrim Script Extender which from what I understand has to be completely rewritten for this version of the game. It's also not done for Fallout 4 and who knows when it will be released for this edition. At least we don't have to pay for mods like they wanted although if they had hired some of the modders to fix some of the issues this would of been worthy of ""special edition.""Morrowind's and Oblivion's main stories felt finished. Here in Skyrim you can defeat the dragons but what of the Civil War? You pick your side and the cities change factions Jarls change. That's about it. What about the Thalmor? It just abruptly stops there no moot to declare who is High King of Skyrim. What about you as Dragonborn? Could you follow the path of Talos and become Emperor or at the very least High King of Skyrim to unite the land against the Dominion?

433730,2016-11-02,0,0,70,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. What did I like? That that it was free. What I don't like? As I've seen several others say I also agree that Bethesda wasted a lot of time and money working on this when they should have been working on more deserving games and I DON'T just mean ES VI I mean either Morrowind or especially Oblivion(which DID just turn 10 this year!)! All the other developers have been releasing anniversary editions for their 10 year old games so why didn't Oblivion get its anniversary edition?!Don't get me wrong yes it does look prettier but only by a VERY SLIGHT improvement over all the environmental mods I had in my Legendary Edition of the game. Is it worth paying full price for the Special Edition? ABSOLUTELY NOT! As several others have also noticed VERY FEW bugs were fixed. Also the other thing I've seen quite a few others complaining about is that using mods in the SE DOES DISABLE Steam achievements and console Trophies/Acheivements so if you care about that go pick up the older version for dirt cheap as using mods in THAT version unlocks them just fine.Btw why is it asking me to check a box if I received it free? Does that mean you readers are automatically supposed to discount my review just because I didn't pay for it? It was nice for Bethesda to do that for Steam users but it's extremely unfair to charge FULL PRICE for console users for a 5 year old game when I've seen the Legendary Edition going for $20 new!,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

But this remaster in its current state is unrecommendable for only a few but meaningful reasons lack of additional content the oversight of at least borrowing some smart ideas from the mod community like HUD enhancements and BUGS A PLENTY.No new content disappointing.No updates to UI HUD or taking any great ideas from the mod community that were vast improvements.Visual graphics look good but I've seen comparable quality with the modding community.Bugs. holy hell. just crashes left and right.

433733,2016-11-03,1,11,309,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Not recommended because again Bethesda relies on other people to fix another one of their top products. I can manage with small bugs annoyances etc. but 1. Not being able to walk through open doors essentially preventing me from finishing quests without the use of the console or mods. Collisions are broken all around.2. Barnabas is EVEN MORE annoying which is almost impossible or so i thought.3. Random objects NPCs and animals can often be found floating in the air.4. Essenntially all of the original vanilla Skyrim bugs are transferred along with introducing new ones.(5. No achievements with or without mods or addons. EDIT I have not touched the game for a few days and suddently the achievements magically appeared go figure.)I'm sick of spending time fixing games instead of playing them. Considering that Fallout 4 is essentially Skyrim with guns and both games were released prior to Skyrim SE I thik Bethesda should do a better job working on a product rather than marketing it. After Thief 2014 i stopped bying Square Enix titles where you spend more time watching opening and closing windows rather than playing. Looks like my blacklist will be expading soon unless there are major improvemets in this product (Skyrim SE). Until then this review will stay negative.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

433736,2016-11-06,1,12,38,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Until mods are brought up to steam (as in SKSE and SkyUI etc.) I will recommend that people use the Legendary Edition instead. If you are willing to wait for mod support then be advised I expect some mods never will fully be compatible with this version of Skyrim due to minor issues. It is also stupid that using mods causes achievements to be disabled mods are simply necessary in Skyrim to fix some of bethesda's bugs e.g. Unofficial Skyrim Patch.Skyrim is the best TES game in the past 10 years hands down. It could have been better but that would've been somewhat unfair to other games.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Not hard to use but a pain to log in when you can't paste into the password box and a completely unnecessaey change outside of folks on consoles.Using mods disables achievements. Adding hunger cold and other mods that make the game more difficult shouldn't treat you like you're cheating. I used one cheese mod on Skyrim a chest full of building materials for Hearthfire everything else I added was a realism mod.

433745,2016-10-27,0,0,3,False,Recommended,Product received for free. A welcome improvement but still room for improvement.I feel like graphically Skyrim SE is what 2011 Skyrim should have been a built in ENB (or very nearly so) better lighting high res textures depth of field (maybe even a little parallax?). The character models are oh kay good enough to play but still lacking the polish of say Mass Effect. The draw distance is still less than great and the water looks like flowing gel but as shipped it's 85% of the way there.The game also has considerable under the hood improvement. It opens in a near instant. Not a single crash thus far. Alt+tab works! (TOOK LONG ENOUGH.) Whiterun loaded in 2.5 *seconds*. I've never seen the framerate so consistently high or loading screens so consistently short. Took 10 years since 64 bit was common but it's here at last. Bravo.Gameplay wise Skyrim SE is still 2011 Skyrim through and through. It was actually shocking to remember what that was like as I'm coming from my heavily modded Frostfall+Requiem+EGO+Warzones hardcore gameplay installation of the original. I just beat Helgen on my first try not my 30th. Everything thus far has been a cake walk. Which reminds me of this article ( http //www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video games/columns/firstperson/9265 Skyrim is Soulless ) and underscores sadly that original Skyrim as shipped is a sort of Potempkin village lots of pretty things to look at but it's all only skin deep. No real challenge no real choices or consequences. This new Skyrim SE *needs* to be modded if for no other reason than to compensate for the critical gameplay elements that are still lacking.Which finally brings me to the missed opportunities. Though some bugs (crashing) appear to have been alleviated there is a huge and unforgivable missed opportunity. The unofficial patches at a minimum should have been included essential as they are and given that Bethesda has known about these bugs for years. It also would have been nice to have seen the original cut content (e.g. Pit Fighters Cutting Room Floor Civil War Overhaul Touring Carriages) restored the argument that they ran out of time doesn't cut it 5 years later. Other obvious deficiencies (slow horses no body in first person no multiple followers no open cities no built in SkyUI) still remain unaddressed as well. Perhaps the biggest missed opportunity is that at the dawn of the VR age there is no built in VR support. VR enthusiasts will rue this day for years.Should you get Skyrim SE? Of course. Skyrim (modded) is a great game. I just wish that after 5 years Skryim were finally shipping as it should have shipped 5 years ago.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Also all the mods that people have been making for 4 plus years for the original do not work for SE so not only does it not look as good as the original when modded with graphic mods but you also lose the 4+ years of work from modders just because they wanted to lick the bung hole of Xbox and ps4 users so they could grab a quick dollar off modders work.

First owned it on the Xbox 360 for which it was a mind blowing experience instantly fell in love with the game. I moved to pc shortly after which only improved the game vastly. It was a medium level laptop I ran it on but the game still felt fresh.Coming back to it five years later there honestly isn't much that stands out. Obviously it's the same game plot and structure but nothing about the new and improved graphics and atmosphere feels well....new. The special edition has had a five year gap and between the two games many modders have managed to achieve even more than some of the new features...they simply don't reflect on what should have been. Sun shafts some slightly improved fire physics and redone textures are about as noticable as it gets (even though the hd textures were already available years prior). Other than that there doesn't appear to be anything visually striking. Even the poor NPC's still have those lifeless eyes...I mean if interection with them is such a big part of the game could they not have made them nicer to look at? This is a strictly Ultra settings opinion...as for the console users I have no doubt that things look nicer. The new edition for PCs however if you aren't recieving it for FREE is not in my opinion worth it. Mods within the Steam community are far more effective and will make you awe at the little details whereas the new edition will make you question the hype you spilled waiting for it to happen.

In short Great exploration insane ammount of quests killing people with swords axes maces magic 'n stuff overall a sh*t ton of stuff to do. Now about the Special Edition First of all it's either better or just as good as the Legendary Edition in every way.The graphics are overall nicer with new Godrays depth of field and much better shadows.Things like bugs and UI (excecpt the new ""Mods"" category in the main menu) were literally untouched (so no bug fixes gotta admit I'm disappointed).But the biggest change is the ditching of x32 and upgrade to x64 of the engine meaning it performs better than original Skyrim expecially in crowded areas even though the graphics are better aswell not to forget that this opens up a whole new level of high demanding mods to be created from a modding community still working after 5 years sicne the original Skyrim came out.But as conclusion I have to say I wouldn't buy it for 40 (got it for free like many others for having the normal game with all DLC) but if you get this as game key or on a sale for 30 or less I can highly recommend it (oh and if you don't own Skyrim at all it's worth the full price IMO).",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

And this outstanding game has become my main go to game or only game. This game and series has so much going for it. With a brilliant story in depth lore too much of it in fact. As well as the exploration and RPG elements that are seen in game. Most favourably I'm in love that you create a character and that character can be whatever and do whatever you wish to do. Whether it be to ignore the main questline which is good but a little on the short side for me personally. With hundreds of diversions and distractions along the way is unbelievable. And I can see myself playing the Elder Scroll's games for many years to come. Playing Skyrim had also seen the purchase of Oblivion and ESO. Just to get a taste of the Elder Scroll's franchise as a whole. And I am amazed. Thank you Bethesda for bringing me THE game that I've been looking for.

The vastly improved shadows are the real improvement here. At noon on a sunny day is where it's most apparent it's not the flickery shadowed mess it used to be. Other times of day have big improvements too and sunsets are beautiful (if a bit overblown).The Volumetric Lighting/Godrays are overdone in foggy weather especially in the rift but also stunning at times the throat of the world or markarth looming over you and casting a huge shadow is impressive. As for DoF I turned depth of field down (but not off) because my character isnt myopic.Also.... Precipitation occlusion has been added! This is the biggest thing for me in regards to the updates real shelter they didnt capitalise on that and add more violent weather however which brings me onto....3/10 for effort.I know bethesda never said this would be anything more than a graphical update. But I really think it was a missed opportunity to really reboot this game and fix blatent issues and gameplay problems. Bugs? Gaps in magic gameplay? (backpedal and die) Light vs Heavy armour gameplay? Archery? Many people have learnt from 5 years of modding and improvements and the games failings really came to light over the years (I would have happily payed for a reboot like that).Finally. The game runs super smooth feels great and loads quickly. Even with the open cities mod my game runs at a fairly stable 60 fps on my old GTX760 high settings... the modding potential for this improvement to performance cant be understated.PS Hurry up with the public CK release please.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

This is a steady improvement over the original Skyrim allowing more objects to be on screen at a time higher frame rate and improved graphics it would be an ideal game to buy... If it wasn't being sold for $40 and that they hid the original version and dismantled the legendary edition they also punish moders and the script extender still isn't released yet. For people who had the OV (original Version) and all its DLC this game isn't worth a cent. The only reason I play this version over the other is that it runs better. My computer isn't high end with an AMD FX 6300 and an EVGA GTX 750 ti with 8G of ram. The fact I had to run a mod to re enable my achievements is ridiculous. The only reason achievements are disabled is because the Xbox uses achievements to give players small discounts sometimes.The game still has many of the same problems that plage Skyrim some of them I mentioned in my other Skyrim review.Do I get punished for running mods that fix your stupid broken game? Don't say that achievement isn't important to a game for it to be fun that isn't the point. They have been slowly taking features out of their games for years now just look at FO4 which in my opinion is a complete garbage fallout and a very generic shooter.

Skyrim with dlc's (and even without them) is really amazing game. Tons of missions areas to explore and pure fantasy fun i would even say its one of the best games to start your adventure with gaming overall. But we are talking about special edition and what it is specially on the start. It adds in game moding menu on standard we must use steam workshop. Some graphical updates and after my comparing they are not really big maybe on screenshots or with everythink on ultra the light is better but on high it looks only bit better no updated textures tho and some technical updates. Its nothink new in the game. Not even new achievements. For those who got it for free its fun way to play it again or finally finish the game but for new players the standard skyrim with dlcs is much cheaper and less demanding version. Overall i am still giving it positive this is one of the best RPG games ever made and with some future updates it should be more stable. On the start game didnt even worked for me so for anyone whose game starts for like 2 seconds but dont show up launch and closes after here is insturction how to fix it.1.

And you get all the DLC which is another plus.What disappoints me the most is the lack of effort on Bethesda to improve some of the major complaints from the original Skyrim.

Definitely not Skyrim.All in all definitely a game which needs to be played in your life.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Probably would have been better to mod the 'old' Skyrim. You can get similar things without dropping another $30 or whatever. Still good for another run of achievements and mindless hours exploring.I think this was more for console users. They can finally get all the mods us PC users have been going on about for years. And this probably looks miles better on consoles. I can't remember the Xbox 360 days. I guess you could also say this is good for people with non gaming set ups. People who don't have space for mods or whatever. It has a good market.If anything I think they went a bit too ott with all this bloom lighting and such. Coming from modded Skyrim with an average gaming PC I'd give it about 6 7/10. Good for what it is but not really ""special"" for Steam users.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

433851,2016-11-13,0,0,0,False,Recommended,TESV SSE is a beautifully optimized version of the original Skyrim. Some people will disagree with this but there are specific reasons for that. Let's take a look at some of them.For newcomers to the game this is the place to start. It features numerous improvements to lighting and overall experience when compared to the original (the unmodded special edition is superior to the unmodded original and addresses some known issues of the latter). Do expect a few bugs when playing the early builds especially weird NPC glitches as expected of a recent remake of such a complex platform.HOWEVER... if you are a veteran of the original one used to playing the optimized and modded version of Skyrim you will probably feel that the Special Edition is lackluster or even a downright downgrade. Why? Because you are used to 3rd party changes that took years to fine tune. What one needs to take into account is that SE is the new platform upon which future mods will be built... many modders if not most have already stopped working on the standard platform to begin porting efforts and SE development. This means that in a few months time the modded version of the Special Edition will (likely) be far superior to the standard one and that alone is more than enough to recommend it. Conclusion It's a must buy for long term players of Skyrim although still raw... some patience will be required for it to be modded enough to shine like the hidden gem it really is.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

This has more bugs and appears to be broken. If I use the launcher to set the games resolution I get 40 50 fps. If it set the resolution manually in the ini I get 130 144 (both tested with Vsync disabled). Also the game will only let me select 720p on a 1080p monitor.

DO NOT BUYI might not have played very much of the game but there were certain things early on that can show that there aren't going to be any changes later down that line. The game looked washed out much like the original the textures were only minimally changed and there are still audio bugs. I'm not sure if it's my PC but I could only get 30 FPS playing this my thought is that it might be capped but I'm not certain. I love Skyrim I've played thorugh the game several times on PC and console but it would be better to not spend money on this and instead buy the original Skyrim and It's DLC if you don't have it already. Pack the original with mods and download the FREE DLC that will get you the same quality as Special Edition and it will be a way better experience then this.

Bethesda need's to step up there game if i want mods i use the nexus mod platform because it is so much better and well made it is less glitchy and has MORE MODS that are ALL FREE none of them are locked behind a paywall. I think i should have gotten legendary edition it has more mods and is cheaper it has no paid mods to make me want to uninstall the game I think that if you are debating between Special Edition and Legendary Edition you should get legendary and get access to amazing mods like playing multiplayer with your friend (Via Himachi) Excluding the rediculous mod situation and badly made patch's that i need to patch anyway the game work's it's ok the game is better than the original and to be fair it is abit more playable than the old one.TLDR the game is improved but paid mods make it worse The game is a better standalone game but not by much a good enough upgrade if i was on console but the loss of the mod's support and the fact that mods to legendary edition make it work better than this does the legendary edition would be my personal choice,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

In either case the fact that the game is now 64 bit (and the ability to adress much more memory) makes this a definite improvement over vanilla skyrim especially in terms of the potential for modding regardless of what you think of the visual improvements.

I find the Graphics aditions to be noticable and enjoyable to have default with no modding needed to look breathtaking and modding it now only improves it further. The modding community isnt QUITE as dedicated to Skyrim SE or at least seems that way with a very slow process or no process in switching mods from original 32 bit skyrim to 64 bit skryimSE ... so unfortunately some of the bigger mods you may have used may not be available .. YET .. most major ones have been switched over and or are in the process of being converted. the primary holdup being the lack of the SKSE 64 bit being done (which is actively being worked on as I type this). Is it esential to make the switch to S? Maybe maybe not.. not yet.. but it shows immense promise. The base game itself will always be great and the modded content will only improve as time goes on to eventually bring it into the standard we were all used to in the Vanilla Skyrim. In time the mods will likely even be bigger and better for SE than the Vanilla one. TLDR It's not a Nirn shattering change from the original however there are enough things to make it worth the upgrade and in time I feel it /will/ have a better platform to work with than the original.

Walked away from it years passed memories faded the dead slumbered...Picked up a Vive recently and I was interested to note that Skyrim was listed under the supported games for Vorpx a driver that makes games playable in VR. I hadn't played Skyrim in awhile it might be a fresh experience I thought.Reinstalled Skyrim to check it out after installing a few choice mods for SE fired up the Vive loaded the Vorpx started Skyrim and... there's several very poignant VR experiences out there like theBlu Batman VR Experience Vanishing Realms games made specifically for VR that give you that sense of ""being there"" Skyrim SE with the Vorpx Driver might as well be one of those games. When you combine these things you stop merely ""playing"" Skyrim and you start ""Experiencing"" it.

All skyrim scenery transforms into one smooth and beatiful world and though there are poor textures here and there especially on NPC's faces and hands overall experience is one huge step ahead... simply wondering around returned me 5 years back in time to the same shocking emotion of immersive alive open world which became solid and refined in terms of visuals again.10/10 I highly recommend game as it is now and no amount of bugs or poor textures can spoil that wonderful feeling you got from playing elder scrolls in new light.I am rather sceptical and whiny gamer but here.. it is simply amazing and I guess with proper adaption of mods this game will live more 5 years as an reference game for RPG genre.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

433933,2016-10-29,0,0,1,False,Recommended,Product received for free. alright first of all let me say this game is a classic and one many rpg players or gamers in general will never forget me included but does this remaster live up to the hype? yes and noI cant really complain about wasting money because I got it for free alongside the other people with all the DLC i digress what i mean by no is the pc players specifically the modded players. I myself played around 430 hours of always 100+ mods and it was amazing i loved the game skyrim base and with mods the entire experience kicks off but any modded player will tell you skyrim just isnt as good without mods the graphics cant compare some followers e.g. Sofia are far superior and much more. And i completely agree I would never play skyrim vanilla vs skyrim modded if i had the choice. and its just the vanilla vs modded experience is heavily one sided on the mod side so theres no point instantly upgrading unless you yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods.but what i mean by yes is in about 2 3 months if enbs are supported and the modders of skyrim port their mods into the new game as many are already itll be faaaaaaaaar better because of bethesda fixing some bugs and the new 64bit engine and the scripts (although when it comes out you should 100% swap to skse se because its far far far superior and many mods require it e.g skyui) so when everything gets updated and ported it should be a far superior experience compared to 2011 skyrim.overall i most likely wont be playing the game for a while at least until skse or skyui somehow is supported for the new game. But when those mods are ported and availible for the game? ill be playing like its 2011 again im really excited for the remastered mods but a remaster of the actual game? didnt need it it wouldve been nicer to see a full new fresh remaster of oblivion or morrowind instead. so in conclusion theres no point instantly upgrading unless you yourself are a modder and want to use the new engine to create mods. However if you just want to play the game without mods go ahead and play its just a better skyrim for you but if you want mods youre gonna have to wait until skse se releases but when it does ill be playing it for sure alongside of many other people,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I never modded the graphics while playiing the original so I'm strictly basing this on improvement over vanilla (graphically speaking) original Skyrim.This is a vast improvement over the original for the most part but it still has a ways to go before it's the improvement I expected. I don't know if they're going to be improving them further in the updates but if so I suggest they start with the character models and waterfalls. Some of the leaves look like virtual plastic and the animals could use some updating too.Overall the environment is extremely well done. I found myself looking at everything and forgetting I was going somewhere. Definitely worth the download. If Bethesda doesn't fix the graphical issues the community will. Plus it's a free game if you had the original.Oh it may just be me but all the sound past the Bethesda logo is way too quiet on my headphones.

The framerate for me on ultra settings isnt perfect (40fps but with below recommended pc requirements) but this is to be expected considering the improved graphics ive also yet to experience a single crash. Now as far as the actual improvments go its a signifcant improvment upon the OG skyrim. Lastly the mods while i personally dont use many (especially with the special edition) the utter rage people have regarding mods on the special edition is idiotic. While yes some mods just wont work and others will need to be updated what were people expecting everything to just work all hunky dory? its a new engine for christs sake. If you dont like it play the OG skyrim with the mods that apprently make it look/run better anyway no ones forcing you to buy this. Anyways mods on the special edition should be bigger and better than before thanks to the special edition being 64 bit.So should you buy it? I would but it thats my opinion look at what the game offers and decide if you can justify spending the gold (and if your pc can handle it of course).,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

The 64bit upgrade gives us a lot more options where modding is concerned and greater stability.Don't really get the negative reviews as some are saying that it was the same game as before which is what bethesda said it would be with some upgrades in certain areas i.e(lighting water shders etc) . This remaster wasn't supposed to be huge for pc it was meant to be big for the consoles. Which having played skyrim on the console I can see how the improvements listed would be huge for console players.Edit. After having played the game for a few more hours I figured I would give my review a little update.The stability in this game is amazing. I remember having a few texture enhancements and getting open cities of skyrim and going into Whiterun just to see my frames tank as soon as the gates opened (same rig with no upgrades between games) now I can open the gates and my frames dont change from 60. Also many of the texture mods from Skyrim work and more are being added to the nexus and bethesda.net constantly. So I still say that the upgrade in the engine was well worth it.Helpful tip run the game in fullscreen borderless it really seems to help performance wise.To those who were wanting to know.I7 4790k980tiGame on HDD144hz Monitor Locked at 6016gigs of Ram,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Now that the game is 64 bit expect much better mod support/ports of mods once SKSE gets updated.Impactful changes Borderless windowed works really well. I can alt tab easily even during loading screens and don't have any cursor glitches in the few times I tried it.Audio quality is a lot worse as they've decided to change the .wav files into .xwm with quite a bit of compression. I'm sure there will be a mod to fix this in the future as it just requires replacing audio files with .wavs or better quality .xwms.If you don't have this for free wait for substantial mod support before buying unless you know you're okay with Vanilla Skyrim.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

This is a GOOD THING. If you didn't already own the DLC for the original game which all came out within the first year and a half of a now 5 year old game and you didn't get the free upgrade the only person to blame is yourself. Clearly you didn't enjoy it enough to buy the extended content for it so why should you get that content for free now? This version of the game very quickly replaced my love for vanilla Skyrim with higher frame rates higher default color contrast and 64 bit processing. The trees are actually green now! I love it!For the best mods head over to the Nexus Mods website (just Google it). If you install all your mods manually and have compatibility issues or it kills your game you'll likely have to start from scratch and re install everything.

At this time the game still has many of the bugs that Skyrim originally launched with like some collisions issues with items ""exploding"" upon entering an area and being sent in every direction possible and clipping through doors when entering. Now these for the most part don't ruin the game really at all but the only thing that remains broken in both versions of the game now is Dragonborn. It is still an absolute mess and requires the use of the console just to fix the quests and advance. Now with these grievances aside the game does look quite nice the graphical upgrade is noticeable compared to the vanilla and the lighting effects do make a large difference especially in the southern forests of Falkreath at night. If you did not recieve it for free for owning the collection I would still say it's worth it just because it is still Skyrim but yes overall it is a small upgrade for the price. 8/10.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I dunno.Now I will give credit where credit is due There were some parts as I explored from an old savegame that DID look different. The character models are noticeably smoother. The fire looks cooler. There's a couple nice lighting effects.But by and large it looks the same as the Ordinary Edition.Downsides I noticed a lot of rings running through everything as I ran around which was not particularly immersive. As I ran through the wilderness in some places I noted that the extra grass shrubs little rocks etc. didn't appear until I got close to them and from a distance everything was flat unlike Ordinary Edition without mods. This was also not particularly immersive. Everything seemed to take a long time to load. Overall performance seemed notably worse even on rather low graphics settings at least when I was in outdoor areas there was a fair amount of general slowness and lag.May or may not be downsides First person view is a bit closer to the ground I think and everything is definitely ""zoomed in"" close up things are REALLY close and you can't see as much of your hands/weapons. This might be confusing to longtime players of the original. Also apparently you now need to have an account with Bethesda in order to use mods. And the main menu doesn't have a link to the options menu which is just dumb IMO but that's a minor point.In summary Updated graphics in some areas that are not that special is the only upside that I noticed. Performance was worse than vanilla Ordinary Edition and I'd say slightly worse than heavily modded Ordinary Edition as well though that varies depending on how much save bloat you have. I did not pay anything for this game and I'm glad I didn't. If you already have Skyrim don't waste your money on this. If you don't well both are about the same price so pick whichever you want.

It was my first Elder Scrolls game and after playing all of them from Arena to Oblivion it's still my favorite and the one game I always come back to after I tire of others.The Special Edition does not dissapoint either. It seems a bit underwhelming to some veteran players because the most noticible new feature the improved graphics have been available through mods for a long time. What I think is much more important is the improved stability. After 20 30 hours into a game the original Skyrim would start suffering all sorts of weird glitches and crashes and mods would often bring that on much sooner. Then there was the constant crashing from running out of RAM an other limitations of the original 32 bit build.Special Edition fixes this and while I'm still waiting for my favorite mods to update a lot of really great content has already been updated or made newly for the Special Edition.Disclaimer I did receive this game for free because I already owned Legendary Edition.

I just think remastering it was a good business decision for Bethesda because of the current generation console players (PS4 + XBONE).

434032,2016-10-28,0,0,437,False,Recommended,"Heya All I am very happy for this update. I have played with Vanilla Skyrim SE and like what I see so far. However I am tabling it for now until some mods I like get converted. I beat skyrim on an un modded playthru during origional release. So I got that feel already. These days I prefer the modded experiance for some aspects of my play thru.SE Pros Updated Base World Graphics Asthetics and ENB (lighting). Seems to be nicer and more true to Bethesda fantasy but with better graphics. So possibly may not need as many visual mods. Played for a short while looked at many world textures and I personally am happy. Engine Converted to 64 Bit allowing game and some mods to function better on current PCs. This paves the way for potentially new mods that can do much more than before. Thats up to the creativeness of the community though.SE Cons ""Unofficial Skyrim Patch"" was not integrated into the base game to my knowledge. I do not know if Bethesda performed any offical bug fixes to the base game or not. But my hunch is we will still need the ""Unofficial Skyrim Patch"" to fix alot of things in the world. Some players have tried the patch on Skyrim SE but it seems to cause problems. So we need to wait for the mod to be updated to work better with Skyrim SE. Old textures on Armors weapons equipment house hold objects dungeon objects and thousands of other items don't look updated to me. Looking forward to the Static Mesh improvement mod HD weapon/Armor mods to be converted to Skyrim SE. Not looking for non skyrim items/equipment meshes. Just would like higher quality meshes for existing skyrim equipment. Kinda the bridge between lore friendly and better looking. Not older PC friendly. If you ran Skyrim on High/Ultra 5 6 years ago you might be at low/Medium settings today with Skyrim SE. If you've updated your computer since then like I did. You might still be at High/Ultra. No NPC or Character mesh/skin updates. Still have origional character looks/feels. Will need modding to touch up some people. Waiting for CBBE to be converted... Don't judge me... &gt .&gt Many older Mods may never work again unless the Mod Author comes back to update it or another mod author takes over the project and tries to update it.Other Notes PC Performance. Some users are reporting sinificant performance issues with their computers. When they list their system specs and I compare it to mine sometimes we're fairly similar. Yet I am not noticing any visual or perfomance issues. My rig is a Win 10 PRO i7 6700k 32GB ram GeForce GTX 970 and Samsung Evo 850 SSDs. Some users are reporting Bugs with the starting scene on the cart. No mods yet the cart still flips the fraq out or the Horses get in the way during the execution scene. Hopefully a bugfix will come for that soon. Mod Development will take time folks. Its up to you to decide if you want to play a limited mod experiance or wait for a while. thank you all and I hope you enjoy the updates and updated mods. Good luck Mod Makers.

No one is making you play this and if it's bothering you so much steam has a feature where they can remove certain games from your library. This wasnt meant to add content i do agree that it could of fixed some of the bugs but I'm happy they didn't. It just makes the game a tad bit more nostalgic. Did they have to do it? No they didn't. And the port to the new engine just makes it more beautiful and immersive. Take it as you will. It's literally the SAME game with the SAME content as The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim released in 2011. It just looks better and that is what they were marketing about it. Personally I really like that Bethesda did this and I honestly hope they do this with Morrowind and maybe even Oblivion.And before I forget YOU GOT THIS FOR FREE YOU IDIOTS SO SHUT UP. They could of said ""Umm so yeah we are gonna release Skyrim again but with a different engine and it will look nicer. And you know what? We are gonna make you pay 40 even thought you already own the exact same game."" They could of. But they didn't. This isn't EA.Edit Grammer",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Seeing so many people spitting venom at this special edition I'm a little dumbfounded.Why do they hate it so much Mods are now incompatible Bugs are still there Saves incompatibility because of mods Bethesda wants moneyWell first of all that's true mods played a hell of a lot in the popularity of Skyrim. They're awesome and indispensable. Without them Skyrim would never be the same. And now they're all broken in this special edition.But they're currently being modified to be compatible it's only been launched 3 days ago and a lot of those awesome mods are already available... So we can expect before long if not all but at least a big majority of the most popular ones to arrive on this version.Then Skyrim was always bugged as hell and this version is not an exception from what people say. However we can expect updates and bug fixes. On this point I have yet to play it enough to talk more about it.Another point was that saves which use mods might be incompatible and that's a shame. But on another hand you can't really expect anyone to give you a warranty on something completely different from what they provided you. And about Bethesda wanting more money. Well as most people on PC we received it for FREE because we loved the game and that's why we bought the 3 DLCs (even though I don't really consider Heartfire as a real DLC). Not only that it's a completely separate installation so if you want to keep your skyrim modded like crazy with your old characters you can play with them without any kind of problem or conflict. And the saves are also separated you only have to copy/paste them to play with your characters on the special edition (at least if you deactivated your mods and saved before). So why would you complain ? And also this special edition is a great way for those who never played this title to start. And I still believe 40e for getting everything is really not a lot for what this game has to offer on the opposite of several other titles where the price never went down with the time the price of skyrim was always reduced to the point of having it at 15e without sales.Now about what they added well mainly they improved the performances. Comparison just came out and the special edition performs better them the old one on the same configuration without mods. Hence you can expect to be able to mod this version more heavily before having performance issues. And that's something I'm waiting for. They also improved the graphics in comparison to the base game and I have to say from the little bit I played it does look good. I was never fan of big ENBs and prefered using IMAGINATOR so it's what I like to play. However for those who like to play with ENBs one of Fallout 4 is already available on the nexus and we can expect a lot more in the coming days. And for those who nerver played this game or don't like using mods it's a really good improvement.In conclusion I do believe this special edition is a good thing. It will help us mod skyrim to a new level and also adds some pretty nice features in addition.PS for those who use laptops if you're encountering stutters you might want to check if you launched the game with your chipset and not with your graphic card and if that's the case force the card to be used.

This is your chance to experience the vanilla game at its best. That being said though it is the vanilla game no mods from the last version will work on it. I have full faith however that pretty soon (once SKSE and SkyUI come out) all the mods really worth downloading will be on the Skyrim SE Nexus. Now if you've played the game before I would still buy it but not at full retail. Wait for a sale by then alot of mods will be out. What alot of people forget to point out is that not only is Skyrim SE a graphical improvement but it is also 64 bit meaning mods will be able to do bigger and better things with upgraded software and more RAM to work with. The game will be more stable and crash less even if you have mods galore. Very soon I think this game will be significantly better than the 32 bit version considering the move to 64 bit architecture. Once mods like SKSE and SkyUI come out which I predict will be in the next month Skyrim SE will have as big of a modders community as the original.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

The colors are kinda more vibrant maybe the fog is more.. visible I guess. Lens flare is alittle more noticable. I can't see any difference in textures really. If you got this for free than I guess no harm no foul. But if you haven't played Skyrim before and you haven't decided between this version and the normal version GET THE NORMAL VERSION. You are better off getting that and modding it to Hell because it will probably look and run a lot better than this version.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Honestly a serious let down The difference between this and regular skyrim edition is that this version uses a very basic ENB setting it has Skyrim Flora overhaul lite lite version and i think a 2k texture mod instead of standard..The interface for addons in game is an improvement but in the long run there's way to many mods missing atm for it to be valuable. Also.On to the largest Issue I had with this...&gt &gt &gt Spoilers Below this &lt &lt &lt No Mods installed just booted up on ultra settings and starting a new game.The usual Cart you start on not sure if it happened to anyone else but mine did a 360 flyby of the world just shortly before arriving into Helgen. After that conundrum I got off my trusted cart and was greeted by a Horse that was stuck out of place idling in front of me. Legit a horse staring me in the face! Not to mention that the horse took up Hadvars spot so Hadvar kept circling the horse while reading his standard script dialog. After finishing creating my character the game runs nicely forward no big issue here some smaller AI screwups that normally happen when they get stuck on different objects here and there.After entering the Helgen Keep with Ralof and going into the Torture chamber there's the option to lockpick a cell to find a corpse and some items. Upon opening this cage the corpse proceeded to ragdoll the out of the cage flying about like a madman before settling down halfway through the wall.. After this incident it was pretty much smooth sailings until I arrived at the large room just before the drawbridge to the end cave.Here 1 of the archers decided gravity was not his deal and flew up halfway into the ceiling and proceeded to suffocate and die. after clearing the room he was still stuck up there in the ceiling.Moving forward into the area with the drawbridge Ralof goes up and pulls the lever afterwards he starts levitating up into the ceiling and flies over the drawbridge area into the cave area bouncing up and down slightly along the way.Confunded by this behaviour as I follow him into the cave when I take my first step on the drawbridge I am forcepushed forward about halfway over the bridge getting confused I back up towards the Keep dungeon again but I am met with an invisible wall and the bridge decides to become liquid form and I just fall through it.After this it was pretty normal up until the bear part which as the true basterd I am decide to sneak shoot him with my newly recieved long bow the Bear decides standing isn't enough but he flies up into the air a few meters and floats towards me with a savage roar... Screaming in fear of flying bears I run around like a crazy person shooting all my arrows into it hoping to kill it but it seems the hitbox of the bear was left on the ground because Ralof starts hitting the air and eventually the bear dies...At this point I'm very confused how this actually got released.. and after getting out of the cave I save and exit vowing to never try to best flying evil bears again.Hope you found it helpful.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Think of it what you want but this may be somewhat of a biased review judging by the fact that I got this game for no cost but I will try to keep it as balanced as possible and address the views as if I was someone purchasing it. For free this game is a great add on to the original game. You get better looking graphics better looking trees better water and an amazing depth of field option. However the dissapointing factor is that some of the major bugs of the old Skyrim haven't been fixed such as the buggy physics that occur when you run the game at anything over 60 frames. You would hope that Bethesda would fix these issues that hundreds of mods were made to fix instead of focusing corely on the graphic enhancement but sadly that isn't the case. All in all the Special Edition removes the need for many ENB's and High Texture Pack mods but many of the bugs still aren't fixed. If you are able to get it for free through owning the old Skyrim as well as all of the DLC's then I would definitely recommend downloading it. If you are a new player to skyrim looking to buy this game I would wait and see what they do with it. I am giving this game a thumbs up because in my perspective I enjoy because it's free but there are still issues with it at release.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

If you're not one for dedicating mods into skyrim on the pc plateform for HEAVY graphical improvements then this is worth getting the rest of the dlc imo to get this free version. However if that deal is over i would strongly recomend just buying the original and mod it anyway. It can become a passion but thats not for everyone and i understand that. Personally I prefer the overall look of skyrim special edition over the current mods plus the fact that it is MUCH more stable even without mods. No crashes so far it has God Rays which no modder has made yet which is a nice touch and everything runs smoothly together. If you only need another dlc to finish off the deal i reccomend it.

A great remaster for an already great game getting mods for this game could not have gotten any easier as you can now install them from the game (though it was already quite easy using nexus mod manager). The graphics are great overall though you can achieve higher using ohter mods (currently not available in the special edition). I played skyrim when it originally came out and it is refreshing to replay it again it doesnt feel old at all. Alduin looks amazing as well as guilds such as the dark brotherhood thieves guild and the companions in whiterun. I highly reccomend downloading the unnofical patch notes from the mod menu in the main menu of the game they work perfectly and does not require you to wait for the develepors to fix. I am quite dissapointed they didnt add and extra quests or DLC but that is exactly why they are allowing you to easily the install the mods. Although the arent out yet i highly suggest you download the following mods FalskaarUnnoficial patch notes (is currently available)the grey cowl of nocturnal (i believe it is called) Legacy of the DragonbornOverall a great experience from the time i played i can easily see myself playing 60+ hours. Although i feel quite dissapointed we didnt get a new Elder Scrolls i feel that this suffices and allows me to immerse myself into the lore of skyrim and tamriel using the main game and the various different mods.i use a gtx 750 ti and an i5 processor and im able to run the special edition at 50 60 fps .great game for the price regardless if its your first time or revisiting skyrim after a few years (or 6 7 months like myself),The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

The lighting is fascinating the extra weather effects like fog/haze/blowing snow is really nice. It added a new depth to the visual aspect of the game. The depth of field blurring has been interesting as well.Pleased that an update has FINALLY fixed the alt+tab issue so you can minimize your game pretty worry free now which is nice.My biggest thumbs down for the remastered game is that they didn't really do much to enhance the ground environment. The trees and plants (not all) still have a very...choppy and 2 D feel to the foliage/flowers which I was hoping would've changed. Still some silly glitchy things like NPCs standing inside of solid stone structures but that kind of stuff is laughable and doesn't ruin anything.If you have the option to get this for free do it. It's not a disappointment in that aspect. Not sure I'd really be tossing out so much money for basically a giant texture overhaul though.

First of all everyone who gave this a negative review knows absolutely nothing about modding or what this this release will actually do for this game.It is sad to see that this has a ""mixed"" review pool on Steam already. I don't usually give a about reviews but I didn't expect you people to shut down this. Not because I love skyrim but because this is literally the best thing that could possibly happen to this game and I'll explain why below First of all this game looks AMAZING for a base version. There are so many people in here on it because (read this in Cartman's voice) ""I already have a modded version and it looks like this already. This is so stupid blah blah"". Let me explain to those of you idiots that gave this a bad review on the first day you exactly what Skryim Special Edition does for the modding community and what this game will become in the next 3 months if not sooner.Skyrim Special Editions main focus was not to put in a few new bushes give the game a new shine and greater viewing distance. That's a bonus. What they actually did here was repackage the game so that it can be executed in 64 bit. They also unlocked and fixed the RAM capabilities. What this means for those of you that don't understand is that this game is now so much easier to mod so much easier to work with and so much more optimized for the future. SO in retrospect all of those beautiful mods that you've seen for the original Skyrim that WILL be redone in due time will be TWICE if not TRIPLE as beautiful and nearly LIMITLESS in capability.. I can't stress enough how important this is. We're basically starting a whole new generation of mods for arguably the most modable game of all time and with it comes a staggering amount of possiblity..So don't just load up the game see that it's the same thing with a few new shiny upgrades and on bethesda and future players that actually read reviews by giving it a bad review. You must understand that they were not just releasing this to make you think the ing trees are prettier. Why do you think they gave it away?? It was to plant the seed of the Skyrim Craze all over again. And trust me this is about to get un ing real.10/10 would rant again",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

434169,2016-10-28,0,0,90,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. Finally! Here it is. The ""new"" Skyrim. First off i would like to mention that I played Skyrim on the PS3 since 11 11 11. After a few years I got an old quad core pc and put a gtx660 in it I started with the Legendary Edition of Skyrim. It worked fine. HD Textures a few mods and I had an easy 60fps on ultra. Nowadays I have an i5 6600k gtx 960 4gb and 16gb ddr4 ram. I could not wait for this game so I got scared when i read the first few reviews. Starting the game it choose ultra settings. After the intro chapter i immediatly started wandering Skyrim. Outside in 3rd person mode and running around with a low sun i have between the 35 45 fps. So i wonder wich graphic card the other users use. Recommended is a 780 and with a quick look it looks like it is better than my 960. Anywho inside a dungeon or building it hits a steady 60fps. So please tell us wich gpu you are using just to know a bit better where the bottleneck lies. For the game itself (i just played for 1 hour now) i could say it is not a big difference. Just like other reviews the lightning effects the water effects and some bloom and flowers are nicer than vanilla. But if you walk past a nice piece of stone shining in the darkest dungeon you will see that the textures arent that nice. I could say they didnt even put the HD texture pack from the original in this game. (please correct me if i'm wrong) The quests are the same well the whole game is the same for that matter. Even the strange things like sneaking trough a dungeon spotting an enemy ready your bow and when you shoot the arrow the enemy moves almost a meter to the side without moving a muscle. I mean come on if this is the level of this ""special edition"" or whatever you like to call it its a shame. Just putting some mods togheter with a 5 year old game isn't doing anything nowadays. I am sure there are a lot more bugs or glitches in the game. They where in the original and if I see after an hour that there are still a few bugs then i believe all of them are still in the game. So maybe just maybe you should buy the original instead of this special edition. Don't forget after the announcement of the special edition all the other skyrim editions rise in price. If you don't like to mess with mods or whatever buy this game...in the sale... For the 10 euro more then the original you could better buy this version. And from now each evening I will pray to the Nine Divines that the Moddcloaks will rise up and modd this game just like the original version. I hope if i dont get lost in Skyrim i update my review. But for now i will recommend this game. Just because it is in my top 5 of best games ever. And hopefully yours too. PS bethesda THANK YOU! for this free game! I really appreciate it. But please come with some updates for the people who cannot play this game like they should with there specs. And please don't be a little tiny bit lazy next time and fix some bugs and some animations from the characters. it brings me back for like 4 years or something.But still try this.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Maybe not worth the full price compared to the old Skyrim but the game at least is definetely better than the original. If you got it for free it is worth to change from the original to this one even if you have to say goodbye to a few mods temporarily. (You can just wait for them to be remade on the SE version) If you're trying to decide wich one to buy i would recommend this one a lot more than the old one. And i'd recommend even a lot more to wait for a sale on this one even if they discount a little 15%.8.5/10 dog paws.

Okay first of all I'm sick of hearing all this whining just because your potato that you have updated your drivers on in 10 years won't run the game at 144fps doesn't mean you have to on the game. First of all I'd like to say this game is way more stable and better looking then the original skyrim and it was nice to recieve this for free as a long time skyrim fan. What's new you may ask? I'd like to address that this game is not a remaster so the content does not change but what does change are the graphics. The graphics are way more smoothed out and are higher quality textures then what they used to be the lighting and godray effects are awesome and make this game outstanding from what it used to be. There's people whining about how they compressed audio files which they did but the characters in the games sound exactly the same this also goes to the music and other sounds. The cons of this game are being so stretched out it's not funny. The greatest thing about this game is they converted Skyrim to 64 bit which means the game is not going to crash if you have half the mods on the Nexus installed and it also means the game won't suffer from too many items in one room moving. It basically increases the amount of RAM your game takes in. I will say something I don't like is the bethesda mod support replacing the Workshop but honestly they almost follow the exact same rules so it's not a huge problem.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I have already unsubscribed from all the mods to play the new skyrim because I thought just a small upscale in the textures would still support the mods but it apears they no longer want steam workshop.

434195,2016-10-30,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,"I can sum up what's wrong with this game in one sentence so bear with me as I explain that sentence. ""There is no native Linux client"" A significant number of developers publishers and gamers read a sentence like that and simply dismiss it out of hand for a variety of reasons with none of those reasons being valid. The point of developing a Linux client for any game or any software package is not for fiscal return in sales nor just for community goodwill. It isn't to showcase technical prowess or to grow a new market. Not is it just to hush up a very vocal stastical minority of players.The point of developing for Linux is that it enforces Good Coding Practices. Applications that are cross developed for Linux and Windows sets a number of high barriers a developer must address. One of those barriers is code documetation. With multiple operating systems in play code must be well documented so that anybody else reading the code later will know what the original developer intended.Developing with cross platform targets in mind from the start also forces the developer to avoid Operating System specific functions. Developers also have an incentive to avoid Operating System specific API's. Native cross platform development also makes it more likely that the developer will leverage more robust development tools check more of the code for errors before compiling get more detailed reports afterwards on what broke during compiling and ultimately produce cleaner code as a result. Native cross platform development forces developers especially game developers to actually test their shader code on a variety of different hardware types. Supporting AMD alone for example could mean making sure OpenGL and Vulkan shader code runs under as many as 4 different drivers. The more physical graphics cards a developer tests against in house and the more drivers against which those graphics cards are tested make it far more likely that bad or error'd code will be noticed and can be corrected. The sheer scale scope and ambition that Bethesda puts into their games is only matched by what appears to be the sheer scale and scope of Bethesda's apathic coding practices. Bethesda games are legendary for massive bugs glitches and any number of wide ranging issues that would normally spell death for any other developer. From what I've experienced players love Bethesda games because there's something to those games that is more compelling than the broken clients used to play those games.For years players have begged Bethesda to open up their game clients under Open Source licenses. For years players have begged Bethesda to let the players fix those game clients at the code level not at some downloadable mod level. For years Bethesda has responded with a flat ""No"" I harbor no doubt that if Bethesda had released the Fallout 4 engine under an Open Source license and let the player base bring Skyrim into that engine then there would have been something special. There wouldn't have been sound files that were compressed using some well let's just leave it at noting that the sound is not compressed using a format from Xiph. There wouldn't have been texture packs that were left untouched. There wouldn't have been broken shader codes. If anything it's likely that the extremely talented player base would have ported the graphics code into Vulkan.When I saw Skyrim Special Edition land with no native Linux client as a Zero Day Launch I knew without even checking anything else or even loading the game up that Bethesda hadn't followed coding practices. I knew just from the lack of a product that the code probably had not been tested on a wide range of hardware or driver sets. I knew that Bethesda probably hadn't used platform agnostic development tools and likely had a wide range of Operating System workarounds black boxes and kludges in the ported game. Other developers might want to take notes. Supporting Linux platforms during the product development process as a cross compile with Windows isn't just to make the fan base feel good. It's a very practical and very effective method at making sure that when the product launches... it's a product that works. Not one that locks up and does nothing for hours on end.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

For the people crying about mod support it'll always take a while and this version will be a LOT better than the original 32 bit Skyrim. One of the main reasons why this version is a lot better already is cause of the variable FPS. youre not forced to play at 60fps all the time like you did before really good for people with high refreshrate monitors.

If you have problems with the bad textures just mod them right now Bethesda has confirmed that all old texture and mesh mods are working with this version.Pros64bit / DX11 surely a lot better for mods than 32bit and DX9Unlocked FPS just think about the physics that glitched heavily in 32 bit when uncapping the FPS with the config file.Few environmental additions and improved lighting.ConsExactly the same game without any bug fixes at all.

With all the bugs that tend to come with a Bethesda game it is still fun to play and you always feel you have a purpose. In most cases the bugs are minor and the game remains very playable.I prefer to play without any mods at least through the base game once completed then it is fun to experiment with them.All in all I highly recommend this game.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

434241,2016-10-27,0,0,308,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Do you like Skyrim or have you always wanted to try Skyrim and have been waiting for the perfect edition? Well this is the one to get.It looks better plays better and works better than the previous edition. Mod support is baked into the game so you can load mods in a manner similar to the way they do it in Fallout 4. There's an actual Mod menu in the game and getting mods is as easy as scrolling around picking the mods you want and clicking a button. You don't have to dink around with the Nexus and manual installation nor do you even need to worry about the Workshop on Steam. It's really very nice to just load and go. The Vanilla version of the game without mods looks fantastic. I'd say it's comparable to the previous edition with some heavy graphics mods but the bonus here is that this doesn't compromise your PC as much. The Special Edition is designed to take advantage of Windows 10 and manage memory a lot better. If you're on a 64 bit system with a bunch of RAM you'll finally get to use it. The end result? A gorgeous game that doesn't crash because of memory holes or other weird issues. There's nothing new here in terms of content. It's the full package of Skyrim with all DLC but they didn't add any new areas or quests. The towns and villages all look fantastic with new plants and improved textures but there are no new secrets to unlock. The landscape is covered with more grass more flowers more plants thicker trees and really excellent lighting and shadows but you won't find any new caves or castles. This is just the ultimate version of a game you've probably already played for hundreds of hours. That said Skyrim really is another life and a way to just wander around in a new world for hours on end and this is the most immersive gorgeous way to do it without going through the technical tweaking of old style modding. Yes you can get more mods (at the time of this writing) for the previous edition and do a lot more graphics wise with those mods but they are harder to install and each one takes a toll on the game's performance and might potentially lead to frequent crashes. If you want to skip all that the Special Edition is a great compromise. While the PC version of Skyrim Special Edition won't be as much of a surprise in terms of graphical improvements as compared to the console versions (which are vast improvements over the last gen hardware's graphical capabilities) it's still the most simple way to get into Skyrim with the best possible graphics and most stable engine on a modern PC. Future mods will no doubt make the game even more attractive and now those mods can take advantage of the memory and power available to them. I dig it. I mean it was free anyway so what's not to like? You should definitely download this one though whether you're a new player or an old hand.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

PERFECT. I haven't touched the game in 4 years but I did beat it on my ps3 back in the day. I am enjoying the new graphical upgrades and I will probably play it again. Of course I know you could modd the original and it's even sharper than the remaster but for what it is this is a nice clean install of the game with great graphics at 64 bit. Mods are also working with this version and more and more are going to become available in the next few weeks.

Now that the price has been lowered from its original 60 dollar price I can for sure say it is worth it to grab this game if you didn't get it for free for having the Legendary Edition of Skyrim.As far as modding go the in game mod loader is pretty decent. If you play Fallout 4 its essentially the same format. Also locks achievements however which is easily mendable with a couple added files. The modding community for this version suffers due to the lack of SKSE support. There is no foreseeable release date for the 64 bit version of skyrim script extender and thats a fairly large issue for people that relied on a couple big name mods in the previous version (SkyUI to name one.)Aside from that the game runs great and was well optimized.

Skyrim S E works with my game saves from the original Skyrim. Just copy and paste the files from the one save games folder into the other. You don't have to restart the game from the beginning. Also on Steam this game can use Steam Cloud to backup your game saves in case your hard drive crashes.Skyrim is the best game of it's type. It is a first person (and/or third person) adventure game set in a medieval fantasy world with magic dragon's elves and other mythical creatures. This game has a story line based on games of the Elder Scrolls series Morrowwind Oblivion and Skyrim.. However you are not stuck to the story line were you move from one battle to the next with some story line to tie them together. You can wander around on it's open world / sandbox map choosing which quests to do and when. If you can't win a boss battle you can do other things then come back when you are tuffer.Not only is it a stable high end game 10/10 in it's standard ( vanilla/ un modded ) version. but there are 1000's of mods you can add to the game to change almost anything you can think of. This makes the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series twice as good. Below is the Nexus website link were you can get game mods the tools to install them and make your own mods. The Nexus website has 10 000's of mods and tools for a long list of games. The mods are all FREE and are made by other gamer's who make mods mostly for the love of their favorite games. Some of the modder's are professional's in the game development industry. This is were I go for game mods. It's like free shopping.

It's expensive. It's just shy of being a full priced game. I don't necessarily agree with this but I accept it because of the reasons mentioned below.I am putting my review up recommending skyrim special edition because Skyrim and it's DLC has been on sale for almost no money multiple times for years. Even as part of the marketing campaign for the Special Edition Skyrim and it's DLC was put on sale so that people who were missing certain DLC or wanted a cheaper upgrade could get that upgrade at a significant discount. I feel the effort made by Bethesda to accommodate PC players leading up to this release cancels out the vocal minority who missed news and updates about the arrangement and are now complaining about the price on PC.Also a side note about the console versions. I feel like the console version is reasonably priced. Modded Skyrim for PC is one thing but to bring Skyrim back on consoles with impressive visual upgrades and mod support is huge. It looked average compared to PC on the PS3 and 360.The effort was made for PC players to get this upgrade for free or at a discount because to us it's not really much of an upgrade. Some people didn't get around to preparing for the upgrade and will now bitterly have to cash out full price if they wanna play now or wait for it to go on sale.

This is still the original Skyrim + DLCs but it looks and feels much better. Highly recommend if you were a fan of the original version like me. PREVIOUS REVIEWSPlayed through the opening scene early today and experienced some serious issues. No full on crashes but I was experiencing some nasty FPS drops down to 7 8 from 110 for seemingly no reason. It happened specifically when the dragon comes down when you're about to get beheaded and while you're making your escape during character creation and in the catacombs. I was able to kind of hack my way around this by Shift+Tab opening the Steam Overlay briefly and that would bring the frames back up for a little bit.Skyrim is one of my favorite games ever and I will 100% play this but I'd wait to buy if you haven't until Bethesda can fix this and the other issues being reported.Update November 18 2016The framerate bug still exists bug crashes seem to have gone away for the most part. I've moved to the beta patches and would recommend those for everyone experiencing similar issues to me. Also I have found a workaround for the framerate drops. Go into your Nvidia Control Panel and under 3D Settings &gt Manage 3D Settings Program Settings &gt Sykrim Special Edition (full path of executable) Change ""Monitor Technology"" from ""Use global settings"" to ""Fixed Refresh"". You'll be capped at 60fps but it makes the game playable.Update November 24 2016Haven't been able to get a consistent 144fps for some reason but I think it may be due to the game not picking up the display adapter settings for whatever reason.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

434310,2016-11-13,0,0,25,False,Recommended,This is coming from someone who already has 700 hours in TES Skyrim Legendary Edition (LE).Skyrim Special Edition is basically Skyrim with all the DLC's wrapped into one package and a graphics update from what I can tell. How can I tell that the graphics are updated? When I had the LE of Skyrim I usually played with mods that increased UI elements as well as certain aspects of the textures like blood. Now the graphics update that I am referring to is that the worlds seems to be more alive than it was in previous editions of Skyrim. Another plus is that from what I've read the graphics engine has been updated to use DX11 and from my experience it runs very smooth now compared to the older versions. Pros +All DLC s available as well as the High Resolution DLC. +DX11+Defacto modding version now+Updated graphics+All the pluses of Skyrim are combined into this as well. +From what I ve experienced the load times are much faster however this could be because the game is now on my SSD.+From what I've experienced the game is much more stable than the old Skyrim was.Cons No Steam Workshop integration yet Some bugs remain Duel casting bound weapons are still automatically set to the left hand Dragon fights are still bland,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

434312,2016-10-28,0,0,72,False,Recommended,So... yeah. Skyrim Remastered is basically the same game as the original version launched in 2011 but with some nifty new graphical effects and the DLC already bundled in. Textures actually seem to be... average at best but mods should correct that in time.The new graphical effects could be achieved on the original game by using mods but their quality varied and performance tended to tank depending on what you were you using. A powerful enough computer could have the OG game looking better than this remaster but more likely than not would have worse performance.Speaking of mods they changed the standard way to use mods! To something far worse. Now you download mods in game and need a Bethesda account to do so. The interface for selecting the mods is the same as on the consoles(I'll get to that) and are ill fitted to navigate with a keyboard and mouse. Also using mods disables achievements.Thankfully Nexus Mods has already updated their Mod Manager to support this new version and there's already file to enable achievements on modded playthroughs.Quite honestly this version doesn't feel rushed or badly ported but its focus is clearly on updating the game to the new generation of consoles and also allowing mods to be used on them. The PC version isn't unnecessary but it is certainly less than it could/should have been.That being said this version IS 64 bit and in time should allow for more things to be done in the game especially once the Scrypt Extender gets a new version. THEN we'll have something truly special in our hands.Owners of the old version and it's DLCs were given this new version for free so I won't complain but until the mods from the old version are properly ported over and/or new mods are made that take advatange of the 64 bit executable the original game CAN look better with the right mods and will have the same content. Recommended but for newcomers stick to the old version for now. I will update this review in case this situation ever changes.Here's to another 100 hours in Skyrim,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I have only played it for a little bit so i do not know everything...First off i'd like to point out that Steam/Bethesda was generous in giving this game for free to those who already have the game + all the DLCs. It made me download it immediately and try it out.From what i've seen so far is that the graphics are improved... yet only the enviroment. The rocks boulders roads trees caves etc. all look better than in the original game. It is easy to notice and it does make the game look nicer than before. HOWEVER..... that is basicly the only thing that is improved. The enviroment got an update and that is it.(I noticed the following... maybe others will notice things i didn't or disagree with me) The characters still look basicly the same... with maybe the faces being a bit smoother. Wood as in houses and wooden structures/objects still look the same or there is little improvement. Weapons/armour still look the same. Hair looks the same. No improvement when it comes to clipping (objects passing through each other.... the guy who got executed before you sunk half through the ground) No smoother gameplay... as in it is still heavily scripted and the character's dialogues still don't smoothely follow up on each other.Despite the little changes for some reason it takes up massive amounts of memory and i get lag all the time. I run Skyrim with tons of mods without a problem and here i can't run low quality normally. Not sure if that is my fault or the game not allotting memory properly.In the end it is still the exact same game. Would i play it because it got a bit of an upgrade? No i would rather play Skyrim with tons of mods than a remastered version without them. Maybe i'll check out more of the game later but for now i'll go back to the original game.I would not reccomend it but purely because there are too few changes to make a real difference. You can try it out and see for yourself but from what i have seen so far.... nah... no thanks.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

(Before I start the game was free for owning original)Skyrim is one of those games that never get old to most that have played it. It's always a game you can come back to. I've played it since the Xbox 360 in 2011 and the game itself is one of the most immersive I have ever played in my life (which is a big deal for me to say) and the content in this game can make you smile frown laugh shake your head in disbelief and many other emotions. You can do things that make you feel completely all powerful feel like the richest man in the world or make you feel downright diabolical. This game basically just a graphically updated verison of the original which is great for those that haven't played it yet but so so for those that have as much more was possible graphically with mods on the original. However the best way to look at this for veteran players is think of the new engine this verison is built on. The possibilties and stability of mods from the original game or completely new ones will be much easier to achieve and realize. Once again this game will become like wine and will only better with age thanks to the mods with the main game still offering 100s of hours for anyone. Overall this game will forever be among my most coveted of games that I will always recommend. Although the bugs of the old version are still present again mods already are taking care of that. One of the best things a game can do is make you feel like you're in the world itself feel like your character is you and what you do has an impact or makes you FEEL something period.

I personally have a 980 ti but im not overclocking. Im running the game at max settings and im getting well over 60fps. If you dont like the graphics then dont get this and just mod the original.

Running a GTX970 SSC EVGA and still maintain 60fps on Ultra settings however when the game loaded a message popped up saying ""high quality texture pack not supported.""Cons Achievements did not transfer. I read somewhere that it said it would have different achievements. Maybe I was misinformed. But there a long list of achievemntes that are the same and did not transfer over. simple as ""reach level 15"" are greyed out even though I am level 32 lol. Overall I would not recommend paying full price for this game unless you have never downloaded it. Its your money though so do what you want with it. I have not experienced any of the laggy buggy gameplay that other are describing on this thread. Load times are the same and it runs smoothly...so far. Ill still play it for the minor bump in graphics. But others have said that a modded version of the previous Skyrim will run just as good or better than this one and you can get it for less money.

If your returning to this game be warned as obvious as this may be the MODS are NOT Steamworks and DO NOT support SKSE (yet) meaning there will be some time before any UI mods come out (as well as many other types of mods.) As silly as this sounds the base Skyrim UI is just terrible and makes the game for me feel like a console game. SKYUI was and still is the perfect PC Skyrim UI it made playing this on PC a dream. Again thats my opionion dont shoot me.

This is a great version to buy only if you have never played skyrim. Otherwise keep your old copy and just buy the DLCs.

While there is barely anything now I believe this will give way for a promising start to an already matured modding community. In a few years time this might possibly be even better than the current original Skyrim modding scene as the new engine packs more of a punch than the original Skyrim. Hopefully paid mods don't make a come back.Pros +Same game nothing much changed story is the same same bugs same everything physics wonky at 60fps etc+Includes all DLC+Slight graphical upgrade from original vanilla Skyrim+64bit also Alt tab works properly now+Really great potential for future modding sceneCons Why default to a controller? The graphical upgrades does not justify the framerate loss. I know plenty of mods that makes the game x100 visually more appealing and does not shed a single framerate Personally don't use it but Steam Workshop is gone Not really a con but if your a big modder like me the scene is nearly non existent right nowMy opinion on The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Special EditionPersonally and in my own humble opinion maybe this version would have benefitted more as a ""console only"" title. By putting it on PC Bethesda has successfully divided the modding community as people will be making mods only for one version and exclusive on the other. Mods with inactive authors won't be able to be ported over to new Skyrim unless someone volunteers to do it. Yes most minor mods can be ported over easily but more complex script orientated or gameplay overhauls will take longer and some mod authors might not even have the incentive to port over.

I want to say that Skyrim Special Edition is a considerable upgrade of the original with way better graphics and enhancements in the vanilla form and now with the constant grouth of the community who keeps porting or re creating MODs from the original Skyrim into the Special Edition this is litteraly the Skyrim to play from now one. The old version will most likely become obsolete soon.There's a lot of bugfixes and waaaay more stability I experienced only bugs and/or glitches caused by my improper installation of MODs or their load order. The vanilla game works flawlessly and if you mod it well you'll have no problem whatsoever.

The updated graphics textures and lighting etc. is a major improvement over the original release. For those of us who spend hours modding our Elder Scrolls games it may not be immediately apparent just how much of an improvement this release actually is. Take a moment to compare the original vanilla release and this new release and you'll see for yourself. This game will only continue to improve as mods new and old are created and updated for this version of Skyrim and you will find yourself returning time and again to play.I have nominated this game for the Just Five More Minutes Steam Award as I've often found myself playing the game into the small hours of the night.If you enjoy exploring an open world in a Nordic fantasy setting then you can't go wrong with The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

434429,2016-11-23,0,0,191,False,Recommended,Product received for free. The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim was one of my favourite games of all time. This remastered version excited me but worried me simultaneously. I was hoping the graphics would actually improve and that modding would still be an option. Mods aside the game is fantastic still and has a new beauty to it with the re work. Some people complain that the graphics didn't improve enough but I think that's complete nonsense. Adding modding into the equation I really like the new mod selection system and how it loads/manages them for you. The customisation options are splendid and I couldn't be happier with the new system aside from some old mods being harder to find. This game has had some crashing issues but nothing that can't be 'rolled out' with some updates. And if you aren't constantly quicksaving in Skyrim do you even care what happens?

Bethesda Softworks decision to reintroduce paid mods to Skyrim is their problem and as far as I'm aware Bethesda Game Studio had little to do with E3 this year. Most of it was handled by Zenimax and Softworks. In such a case I do think a lot of people are hating the game studio for a sin they didn't really commit.If you're willing to get past this fact and have a rather decent computer Special Edition is Skyrim but prettier. Of course mod transferals for a lot of popular mods are complete but some of the smaller mods and the unsupported aren't. I recommend this product simply because it is not a bad game. Bethesda SOFTWORK's decision to do this to Bethesda GAME STUDIO's product is indeed moronic and a corporate failure.

TL DRDecent changes to an already good game but Bethesda deserves a thumbs down for stabbing their customers in the back... twice! If you wanna know what they really done to earn the hatred against them then make sure of reading the rest of the review. The whole problem started with Bethesda and Valve trying to introduce paid mods back in April 2015. It was a complete disaster. Valve took the whole system pretty much immediatly down due to the massive sh*tstorm the playerbase unleashed.As reaction to it both Valve and Bethesda apologized for it here's Bethesdas reaction ""We have retracted our paid mod programme and do not plan to reintroduce this system again as it was heavily disliked by both users and creators alike. We at Bethesda apologise"" BethesdaWe all know how that turned out right? Not only did they introduce a new paid mod programme but also they didn't really waste much time to work on it. Because with the release of Fallout 4 in November 2015 they laid the first part of the foundation of the Creation Club.By disabling achievements for modded games they made the first attempt to lower the reputation of free mods. Some might argue that there are good reasons for it because with mods you can make it a lot easier to get certain achievments and there were even mods to unlock any of them in an instant. Those arguments really have some good points but if Bethesda wanted to look after ""fair play"" then they should have penalized the use of the console commands too. Since they didn't it should be clear that ""fair play"" wasn't the intention behind this decision and the Creation Club is proof of it. Creation Club mods doesn't disable achievments.Then Skyrim SE got ported to the 64 bit engine of Fallout 4 with the same ""no achievements when modding"" system. And while they tinkered a bit on the graphics I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who thinks that Skyrim SE only got ported for the Creation Club. If they really wanted to create a real Remastered Skyrim and want it to be the successor of one of their most bought games than they would've fixed at least the biggest and worst of the thousands of bugs Skyrim has. But they didn't really fix any bug. In my opinion this is one of the biggest arguments to show that it's solely a rushed port to get another game ready for every platform to bring in the ""big money"" with the help of the Creation Club.Some might say ""But they gifted Skyrim SE to so many PC player that shows that they care for their fans.""Ye... uhm... NO... not really. That's all strategy. Pretty much the same strategy Microsoft did with their Windows 10. Bethesda surely knew that there wouldn't be that much player on PC who would buy the Special Edition when there are that many mods for the old Skyrim available to mod the ever living crap out of it and make it even look far better than Skyrim SE. Because of that they gifted it to every PC player who had the ""Legendary Edition"" (All DLCs) of Oldrim. Like I said similar tactic as Microsoft give the new version away for free to make more money afterwards. MS does it with selling the spied data and Bethesda tries it with the Creation Club.""But you don't have to buy from the Creation Club it's completely optional just ignore it.""It's not really that easy. As any publisher/developer is just interested in one thing Making money period. Some others started with those greedy anti consumer tactics a while ago and guess what? Bethesda now tries to hop on that train too. They are trying to use the modding community which keeps their games alive to make money for them. As of now yes we don't have to buy anything but when we don't make a stand it can and most likely will get worse. Do you really think they keep this model of the optional Creation Club in future games? If we don't make a stand then it soon will be ""Game Over"" for free &amp sharable mods. If they get away with the Creation Club it will be CC mods ONLY in future games. The Creation Kit will be locked away behind the Creation Club and/or mods can only be shared via the Creation Club and the price tag Bethesda will put on it. And yes I know that's pretty much the worst case I'm describing but will you really find out if I'm right or not?One big problem is that there are many PS4 player who will buy from the Creation Club because they can't really get mods because of Sonys BS. And of course sadly there are also some naive idiots (sorry but imo they are) who believe in Bethesdas marketing lies.So I beg all of you to stand up and fight against Bethesdas greedy anti consumer tactics and STOP countering this fight just because you don't understand why we are fighting. But here I try to give an explanation to each and everyone. We need to get an even bigger sh*tstorm going than back in 2015 because this time there is no Valve who stops them and they really try to force this BS this time. Some might say we overreact but that's not the case here. Bethesda don't care at all for their fans and they stabbed us in our back for the second time now. They're just sitting it out now and are waiting that the storm of negative comments and reviews calms down. The only reaction they gave to their fans was that they lowered the price tag on the sh*tty Survival Mode in the Creation Club. But they didn't say anything about this huge and obvious sh*tstorm and that exactly tells you how much they care. The price of the Survival Mode was in close to all cases just one little part of the rants against the paid mods as a whole and how damn greedy and out of their mind Bethesda got. But no Bethesda don't say anything about the sh*tstorm and they surely wanna completely ignore it and sit it out. If they would mention or comment it in the slightest it would be all over the Internet via some news sites in no time and boy... that would be bad for them.I hope there are many who will make sure that Bethesda won't forget their bad decision until they hopefully shut down the Creation Club cancer. And if we do not prevail because of Bethesda ignoring us then do the right thing and ignore their games and don't buy any of them as long as they continue their greedy ways!Summary Bethesda f*cked with us back in 2015 apologizes when Valve pulled the string and Bethesda started immediatly to f*ck with us again disabled achievements for modded games in FO4/Skyrim SE are most likely to be sort of a bad reputation for free mods port of Skyrim to 64 bit was just another step to spread the Creation Club to more people gifting Skyrim SE to PC player is just a try to get some of them to Skyrim SE so they can possibly make more money afterwards if we don't make a stand and ignore it OR even counter those who are fighting against it will most likely result in ""Creation Club mods only"" Games in the future We will need everyone in the fight against this anti consumer method because there surely are some people who will buy mods Bethesda ignores the storm of negative comments/reviews and tries to sit it out. if we don't let this sh*tstorm calm down we might have still a chance against those forced paid mods system last but not least Fight with your wallet! If they don't stop ignoring our wish to take down that paid mods system than ignore Bethesdas games tooWow quite a wall of text.

This is what's supposed to be the definitive version of Skyrim with Remastered graphics and various improvements over the original game along with coming pre installed with all addons from the original. That's not to say that this version doesn't come with it's own flaws as well. A number of old bugs from the original still remain and some new ones have been created. When I first installed the game upon release it was REALLY buggy black screen CTDs (Crashes to desktop) and could only when I did manage to get into the game there were flashy light patches everywhere and a nasty 10 15 fps.To fix this Nvidia has released a new driver update which comes with optimization support for Skyrim Special Edition. In addition going into C Users USERNAME Documents My Games Skyrim Special Edition (Or whatever it is for you) and setting the iVSyncPresentInterval value to ""0"" (that's zero without quotes) fixes the problems. I feel the horrible performance issues was due to Steam releasing the game a day early prior to graphics card driver support optimization being released for this game. Basically just update your drivers and disable Vsync from the game's .ini file and you should be fine.Some things to look forward to in this version The original Skyrim was running on a 32 bit engine resulting in a max of 4 GB of RAM usage for mods which was the sole reason why the game gradually became unstable the more mods you had. This version runs on a 64 bit engine holding 16 Exabytes of RAM (which is equal to 16 billion gigabytes) which means the game is more stable and is capable of carrying basically a near infinite supply of mods without crashing. So no need to worry about ridiculously long mod load lists you can indulge and bask in nearly as many mods as you like without worrying about CTDs. For those complaining about mods disabling achievements there's actually already a mod released on Nexus that disables achievement disabling due to having mods. The atrocious load times from the original game have been fixed. Expect less time waiting and more time playing Skyrim. While the original game can still at the current moment look better with ENBs (visual enhancement mods) installed players should remember that this is the BASE GAME. This how beautiful the game looks without any mods imagine the possibilities for when the modding community in this game begins to mature? With the new 64 bit engine this game's modding future looks brightly promising. Players should expect a modding community that will grow exponentially faster than the original.Can't really say the game's full price is exactly ""worth it"" in its current state since the modding community is still premature but if you recieved it for free might as well give it a shot. Try the above optimizations mentioned previously it may or may not help your case.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

In bethesda's credit they have ventured and battled for the concept (now reality) of mods on console although these mods will never amount to the ubsurdity nor creativity that you can find on PC it gives dedicated fans enough to stay happy and entertained. Although i belive this is a great breakthrough they've made a grave mistake implemeting their mods system into the PC version (and obviously paid mods i am not getting into detail with this as you've probably already seen a paragraph about how this is the coming of satan). Steam workshop was thriving and although we had some hicupps everything got back into fighting form bethesda understandably want to get more users on their platform it's called making profit and growing your mailing list.Here's my problem with most reviewing this product they're focousing on mods and or bethesda although a vital part of the game for many it is not a review about the game it's about the community created content and the worsening ethics of the company behind said game if people reviewed the game for what it is the game then these reviews would be astoundingly positive although there is the far superior and better game (the original skyrim) the only thing that has changed in this game is the mods system wer can all agree on this skyrim is a special game along with the ES series this game hasn't ripped out its beauty nor stupidity thus to me it is a great game although i would pick the original release over this every day it is still worth it if you don't plan on modding your game to hell.I am reccomending this game as it is the game.

434537,2017-01-03,0,0,125,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Game in Brief /b I recieved this free as did everyone who already purchased Skyrim prior to the Special Edition release.Truth is there's only really a small handful of changes to me. The enhanced graphics the replacement of steam workshop with Bethesdas own catalogue of mods on their website and lastly the ability for console players to utilise the mods too rather than them being confined to pc players like usual.Graphics Overhaul /b The graphics are undeniably breathtaking. There's a new abundance of airy atmospheric purity when venturing through the tundra of Skyrim. The immersion doesn't just stop at textural updates either there's an increased wealth of nature both creatures and plants/trees/bushes and so on... Yet I find myself still having to use additional graphic related mods despite the magnificent landscape improvements. For example the water appeared to me as just the same as the normal version of Skyrim as did some other general aspects like the textures of indoor objects for example. Replacement Modding System /b The new mods system could be either viewed as either worse off or just the same as the traditional Steam Workshop but I can't see anyone saying that it's better. Essentially it's just replacing the Workshop with Bethesdas own catalogue of mods. This also means a change to the system of subscribing to mods before starting the game to a system where you essentially do the same except from the modifications section in the start menu before you load your game. So it's different but it's not really that different other than the fact that you have to create an account at Bethesda and start using an additional modding system when the initial one from Steam was just fine. Luckily you could just use Nexus Mod Manager which is good considering that most people used it over steam anyway for the original Skyrim.Bugs /b Finally a lot of people have told of how they are experiencing bugs glitches and so on with the game. So many players reported bugs in the questlines that it gained a reputation after a lot of the bugs ended up being quite funny in the end. I can't say I've had the misfortune (or fortune depending on how you look at it) to experience any major or even minor issues but it's still worth mentioning just in case.Conclusion /b Concluding I don't think it's really worth it for PC players when you could just carry on with the original version of Skyrim and use a combination of ENB mods to make the game look beautiful and carry on with your favourite mods in NMM ignoring the new Bethesda direct modding system. Perhaps that's why they gave it to us for free.For console however it's worth it just for the ability to mod without having to find a special type of console and so on. I just wouldn't pay too much for it to be honest.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I can make it my mission to collect all of Skyrim's sweetrolls and store them in my basment. I can stumble into a cave in the mountains and end up in the amazing Black Reach city. I can spend real life hours reading your books. I'm taken aback every time I load into the outside world at night and see the northern lights.

This is the best version of Skyrim that exists presently and so if that is what you're seeking you'll find it here.I find people's negative reviews to be rather odd given that this product was very upfront about what it is. This is a re release of Skyrim remastered as 64bit to enhance mod support. It allows for greater object placement greater RAM utilization in a game that historically has been very resource intensive and mod support for systems that previously did not have this option.If you previously owned Skyrim this version was given out free of charge.The game is exactly what it advertises to be and nothing more or less. They ported the game to 64 bit and fudged around with the shaders/FX. All the old bugs are still there as is the Unoffical Patch that fixes them. The negative reviews baffle me particularly the ones bemoaning the lack of an Oblivion or Morrowind remaster. Complaining that a remastered Skyrim isn't a remastered Oblivion/Morrowind is like complaining that your Hamburger isn't Spaghetti. It didn't advertise itself as spaghetti didn't promise to be spaghetti and no reasonable person would begrudge it for not being spaghetti.Reviewing the product on its own merits like a normal person all I can say is that this is Skyrim ported to 64 bit.

That pretty much sums up this version of the game. If your used to playing the game modded your likely to end up disappointed. However now that Skyrim is on a 64 bit platform the new mods for the game will have far less constraints. If you have an unmodded save however you can directly copy the save into this version and it will work. Honestly asking if you like this version is the same as asking what your favorite color is. Skyrim is still skyrim and personally I like that I can now dump more then 4GB of memory into the application. Besides that I havent really noticed much difference.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

Average It has an intel i7 and 10 gigs of ram It can run PUBG at a solid 25 30 FPS if I have settings at mid low but this game will barely run at 15 FPS. Not to mention the numerous graphical errors! As soon as I started the game up I went to the mods section which you need a Bethesda account or something to use. Then I started up the game and noticed a horrible lag and for some reason random parts of everything would flicker in and out of existance. Not to mention how the game looked like the original Skyrim but the draw distance was worse then your average N64 game with fog everywhere to compinsate! However my biggest problem is the fact that Bethesda had the balls to hide the original Skyrim just so they could charge an extra 20$ for this. I personally reccomend The original Skyrim which can be found Here http //store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/ The original works great and looks better too the only problem is that it does not come with the DLC but I got over that when I saw this pile of garbage.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I coping and pasting my review for the original version my review for this SE version will be at the end ""The best part about this game is you can mod it so its nothing like the base game which is... mediocre. If you have havent played oblivion you were robbed of the ability to know this game is bad but its ok because its not your fault you dont know any better. Still I reccomend this game because there are so many mods there are truly limitless possiblilties While betheda tried their hardest to take the fun out of this game( magic that doesnt scale no spell creation like in oblivion/morrowind no improvement on sword combat removal of agility and hand to hand skills cant use magic and two handed swords at the same time anymore because you have to have magic in your hand now becuase it looks cooler and I cant drink 100 bottles of skooma and vault over an entire city). Moders are the true reason this game deserves to be bought.Also DLC is actually pretty good imo.Seriously dont be an idiot and use the steam workshop for mods use the nexus its 1000x better the steam workshop has about 1/50th of the mods.I give this game 1 circle out of 3""Everything I said still stands. This game currently however lacks a build of the SKSE which is a tool that modders use to create the more complex mods so right now there arent very many good mods because the majority of the ones for the original version cant be ported over yet.However if youre willing to except that than this game loads a ton faster and overall is much more sturdy so it has the potential for more and greater mods.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

I have played the 32 bit version heavily modded for a few thousand hours over the years on a pc built in 2010. It was a lot of fun.

Objects pop at short range bandits don't fight back but just stand there hunters pop out the roads at short range. The graphics away from the Whiterun area seem to be low res more like Fallout 3 than the old Skyrim.Update after 50 hrs play patches have improved the lagging. But objects still pop at short range.

This is a great game and it will replace the original oldrim just due to the game being far more reliable and able to handle alot more mods in the special edition. Alot of people are whining below about the fact bethesda made this version for paid mods not realizing the fact that bethesda still allows us to use the free mods which there are thousands of online.

You Dumbasses. SKSE stands for Skyrim Special Edition not script extender anymore for this we need to wait for SKSESE Skyrim Special Edition Script Extender thats what MOST mods work off of and will NOT work until an update is out for SKSESE which will take a couple months as the workers of SE can not do anything until the game was released. Now you can use Wyrebash to convert some mods over like Skeletons like CBBE or UNP ApachiiHair and Eye mods while theres plenty of other mods that are already up on the SKSE page on NexusMods.http //www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/?Majority of these mods can be installed Via NMM without having to do anything and others you can do manually (which is always the best thing to do) I myself am running a reshade covered up ontop by a ENB texture updates and all.My SKSE looks like a gritty old film with grain effects on screen with crazy sun and weather i LOVE it way more than my Realvision i had on Skyrim. Now to the Stability. In old Skyrim you could spawn in 200 NPCs and nuke them and your PC would drop to 5 fps no matter what your rig was and possibly crash. Now though i can spawn 500 NPCS make them fight FFA style watch them fight for 20 minutes and all lay there bloodied and dead with only one person left without going under 50 fps (Note i have a 980 GTX). So where all these people are going ""hurr durr my old mods dont work hurr durr its not that much better"".

434648,2017-02-09,0,0,120,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. I didn't review Skyrim the first or second time I played through it in the original version and it almost goes without saying the game is fantastic.Any meaningful discussion about it has to be relative to something else be it the other Elder Scrolls games like Oblivion or Bethesda's other series like Fallout. Skyrim is clearly an evolution of the Western open world RPG genre both within the industry as a whole and specifically with its place in the Bethesda lineup.Compared to Oblivion the questing system is simpler and for me that means much improved. The leveling system is somewhat similar it's use based which is usually my favorite kind. Here the Special Edition beats the original with the inclusion of the Legendary skill feature which allows a character to reset a skill and therefore continue using it to level up. Without this it was a lot harder to improve at higher levels.Skyrim is smaller than Oblivion both in raw physical terms and in the number of NPCs and quests. Oblivion itself was smaller than Morrowind and so on. This is a sacrifice for the high fidelty we get great writing and voice acting throughout. It's almost not worth mentioning though because the number in Skyrim is still so high that any discussion about size borders on meaningless. I'd rather have fewer high quality quests anyway.Skyrim feels a bit sparser and certainly more mountainous than its contemporaries. This isn't a complaint merely an observation. It lends to the sweeping feel of the winter landscape. And the verticality is a nice change from other relatively flat maps.The Special Edition ramps up the graphics fairly significantly. The textures are equal to the high resolution pack available for the original but the lighting and particle systems are much improved. There's also the inclusion of depth of field and other blur effects that really help modernize the engine. Strangely the field of view was changed to be much tighter. This aligns the game more closely with FPSs like Call of Duty but it is an odd choice here and it threw me off initially. I think I prefer the original.Other than that there's not much to say. Skyrim is so prolific in modern gaming culture that everything from the Dragonborn to the iconic helmet to the made up phrase ""Fus Ro Dah"" have become common things to see on forums or in web comics. The Elder Scrolls are a beloved institution and this entry does them justice.It was really nice of Bethesda to make this version free for their fans. It makes me feel well special.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

434780,2019-01-03,0,0,10,False,Recommended,"Sonic 3D Blast also known as Sonic 3D Flickies' Island in Europe is isometric take on a mix of Sonic platforming serving as a spinoff to the franchise and Flicky collecting'n'leading hot action. It was developed by Travellers Tales and Sonic Team former doing main programmer job while latter came with game design ideas and some more. Well they did want Sonic 3 to be isometric to begin with. Also riding on whole pre rendered trend that went hip with Donkey Kong Country. Published by Sega in 1996 in the West only. 32 Megabit ROM the biggest that Sega Genesis can see at a single time.There also were Saturn and PC versions made near the end of development of this supposed Genesis swan song replacing the cancelled Sonic X Treme. Saturn had improved graphics redbook soundtrack different actual 3D special stages analog input. It's technically the best version. PC version was similar but lacked few graphics and had 2D parody of special stages yet had autosave feature.Sonic Blast on Game Gear is a different game despite fitting in marketing wise.The game that you have here is nothing more than emulation of Sega Genesis version.I don't usually talk about mods but Director's Cut exists and it was made by game's main programmer so it's sorta semi official. None the less back to what Sega gives us there.Now technical part about Sega's emulation here The Sega Classic games that you purchase on Steam count as DLCs for ""Sega Mega Drive &amp Genesis Classics"" game that should appear in your library.It has Bedroom HUB which is the one with many features yet lags for many and Simply Launcher which lacks Workshop and Online but at least it works just fine for everybody.However Simple Launcher has it's fair share of glitches as well. It can crash. And it does the second time you go to main menu so always quit after saving there so it doesn't crash when you want to save next time!Emulation itself mostly sound isn't that good but it does it's job. Also yes emulator supports quick saves.As alternative you can use external emulator to run games that you purchased. Sega kindly placed in all games that you purchased in ""uncompressed ROMs"" folder that program itself doesn't use just change file extension to "".bin"" or so. The file for this one being ""SONIC3D_UE.68K"".I also demand you to read digital manual of this game first. You can find it here on store page or go to ""manuals"" folder of game root and open ""S3DB_MG_EFIGS_US.pdf"".Robotnik has discovered that Flickies on Flickies's Island can actually travel between dimensions by using huge rings. So he trapped them all in Badnik robots to search for Chaos Emeralds. These robots aren't any different no dimension travel there. Sonic is back here and ready to save em all while his two gang members chill around.The core gameplay keeps the Sonic formula going. You can run around and you can jump. Seeing how it's isometric it has a separate button that you can roll with. Or spindash if standing still. You still defeating enemies by either jumping or rolling. Albeit using slopes by rolling doesn't play a big role here at all these are weak slopes. The controls have some inertia to it pleasently. Too bad Sonic can't immediately turn 180 degrees around he does a small circle. Still uses rings health system where as long as you have any rings you will survive a hit but then you have to recover all the scattered rings.It's a rather forgiving pleasant take on isometric style. You can run in all 8 directions. It hides nothing important behind walls. There are shadows for everything. The floor always has checkered tiles so you can measure borders are clearly defined. While Sonic is a bit too fast the game doesn't require much precision platforming. Well there are few but you can cheese most of them by using nearby spring pad or so. The levels are varied as well some having sorta puzzle elements. Spinning pads are great on the second zone.Protip You can break ice spikes in Diamond Dust by rolling into them.Powerups are back through breakable monitors. Invincibility extra life speed up so on. By the way Sonic icons that aren't in monitors aren't extra lives by medals. Collect 10 of them and you will get a continue. There are shields each giving you extra hit against normal stuff. Blue one is immune electricity red shields protects from fire golden one gives you active ability where you do Protip Get a red shield in a Volcano Valley or die.Each zone has two acts along with a boss one. The first two acts are divided into two three stages. And in each stage you have to save five flickies. That means there are only five badniks in a stage and most of them are static non threats. Not too exciting. At least game somewhat makes up with stage hazards. But the game is still too easy. Then you break those robots and have to grab birds. This is where Flicky inspiration comes in. The birds will follow you in a line and they can be broken off with projectiles after which they scatter around. It worked in Flicky which was a tight 2D game where you constantly get chased by cats you would die if they touch you and simply scatted lines of flickies if they touch those. With risk reward applied as you got score by bringing in bigger lines and that would lead to getting extra lives in a tough game. Here? Not a tight design it's just there. Projectiles may throw birds off but that just happens not something you pay attention to. Collecting birds over lava is pain. There is too much space nothing chasing you. Yea. It's just there just making you spend a bit more time in levels and thus isn't exciting.There is usual optional quest for 7 Chaos Emeralds. Actually they look like Halls candies which would explain why Sonic can't turn into Super Sonic. Super makes games too easy anyway. You do get an extra final boss and good ending however that's good. To get an emerald you must find Tails or Knuckles first just chilling. Both of them appear in each act hiding or appearing somewhere in previous stage once you progress feel free to backtrack. Last appearing in Volcano Valley. It does mean you can get two emeralds per act one from each. You get extra life on repeat. Just give these fams 50 rings. Though they will take and store any amount so don't bump into them.After that you get into a special stage. You run over bridge collect rings and avoid bombs. It looks incredibly smooth the best on Mega Drive. Albeit gameplay is a bit plain and is too easy. Still fun.There are usual bosses. Robotnik every time. Most often you just wait for him to get down and hit him then avoid his stuff repeat. Varied health. Not bad but not too cool.Protip For Volcano Valley boss instead of trying to get into pipes first you should curve your jump off side floor to hit Robotnik then you will be bounced backward onto pipes.Not much options. Just sound test and controls. Bare minimum!As for graphics. Well. They tried to do DKC thing with prerendered sprites because it was still cool albeit 1996 was somewhat late. Which isn't the smartest thing to do on Genesis as compared to SNES it has low amount of colors. Still devs deserve some love for managing to create smooth vibrant world. And fitting intro FMV into Genesis cartridge is just awesome. Too bad that ending is just a bunch of images with text.Music is great too. Chiptune goodness the best from few composers on the project.Overall eh. Mixing Flicky and Sonic is a nice idea as evidenced by game like Wiz'n'Liz albeit that one was only somewhat Flicky. But this isometric execution of it is weak. I still wouldn't call it a bad game. Pick only if you want some chill isometric platformer.",Human: Fall Flat

434795,2019-01-07,0,0,13,False,Recommended,Bought it not for full price. It's totally worth it if it's marked down. Took me and a friend about 8 hours to complete all maps the first time. Second time less than 3. There are so many different ways you can solve the puzzles which adds to the fun.What would make this game great is officiall support for workshop maps and a map creation tool instead of having to get hold of a modded version of the game and create maps in the unity engine.,Human: Fall Flat

I love just grabbing another person and messing them up while they try to do something. I enjoy trying to get somewhere where you do not belong or at least have to do something else to get there. I like the platforming and puzzles that make you think. It is like Portal only funnier! I suggest to pick this game up if you enjoy puzzles platforming and just all around hillariousness!

It can be VERY hard at first but once you get the hang of how the game mechanics work its pretty damn easy actually. I kinda mastered how the guy moves around and stuff and found out ways to lift my self up into spots where you shouldnt go and basically cheat the system and get to the end of the level much quicker.

The game was definitely a ton of fun and if you want something light hearted with some unique physics based puzzles give Human Fall Flat a go.

434852,2019-01-05,0,0,6,False,Recommended,It's a fun game with quite an open ended approach to solving the puzzles it throws at the player that becomes even more fun the more friends you have playing it with you. There are very often nooks crannies and alternate routes to be found which is also fun to explore as I did. However the game can be finished in a day and I personally don't feel it has too much replay value if you've already thoroughly explored the maps you play on. Take this with a grain of salt though because I don't often replay a game once I finish it.If it's on sale definitely buy it because it is a fun experience overall it's just a shame it's so short,Human: Fall Flat

I really do because it's hilarious when you fail and it's only matched by the sense of discovery and accomplishment you feel when you succeed. The times when we spent like a whole season arc on some crazy adventure that brought us right back we started are just as story worthy as the times we had stupid terrible ideas that ACTUALLY WORKED... and we had those often.

434881,2019-02-01,5,210,15,False,Recommended,On paper an indie game made by a lesser known French studio where a lesser known faction of the 40k mythos is pitched against a lesser known enemy of the 40k mythos using a plethora of weird mechanics and opaque systems has all the hallmarks of that most well known of gaming phenomena the utter waste of a Games Workshop IP.It is of note therefore that the Tech Priests of Bulwark must have anointed their design work with blessed oils and the studio must have been thick with the righteous smoke of the holy cencer because as it turns out it's a quite remarkable little game and one of the best and most original uses of a GW IP I've seen in a long time.Firstly there's the quality of the writing. I honestly cannot remember the last time the 40k universe felt so visceral and real. There's a genuinely deft touch at work here which makes it feel like actual science fiction rather than genre fiction. From my 15 hours of play I know and care about the AdMech more than I've known or cared about a 40k faction since the 1980s. Also of note is how the writing and the awareness of the lore feeds directly into the game design choices the writing doesn't feel like a layer than sits atop the mechanics but rather a well executed design facet. It's really very clever and a joy to behold.And so to the meat of the thing how does Mechanicus play? Well the AdMech (short for Adeptus Mechanicus) are the faction of humanity who act as the scientists the engineers and the guardians of ancient lore all rolled into one. They make and maintain everything from Storm Bolters to Titans and they do so with a pseudo Catholic religious fervour. They also self augment machinery into their bodies which makes them as much Cyberpunks as Apostles. Anyhoo a Mechanicus spaceship rocks up to a dormant Necron world and triggers it's slow but inevitable awakening. Your commanding officer soon determines that your cohort will either stop the Necrons or die trying.Play consists of talking to one of your Tech Priests and taking a mission from them which you will lead down into the many tombs that riddle the alien world. Each Priest has their own agenda which in some cases is in direct opposition to another Priest. Scaevola talks in a datastream it's humanity and emotions almost non existant. Scaevola wants to acquire knowledge from the Necrons. Scaevola clearly admires them and expresses pleasure when new enemies are discovered. Videx speaks in aphorisms culled from the holy texts of the Omnissiah. Videx believes that the tombs should be scourged of all xenos influence. Videx constantly counsels that humanity courts corruption by examining the Necrons and quotes scripture to back up his stance. The banter between these two and their commanding officers attempts to mediate between them is really very entertaining! Who you choose to do missions for appears to have a direct effect on how things pan out.Mission picked you then choose the troops you wish to deploy. These consist of varying types of meat shield (which you diversify the roster of as the game opens up) and your precious Tech Priests. The mission itself is then a top down affair where you are shown a map detailing all the available rooms and corridors. From here you plan your path through the tomb. Most rooms offer a Choose Your Own Adventure style choice wherein various rewards and penalties will be levelled. Within each tomb there will also be at least one fight where the map dissolves into XCOM esque isometric turn based combat.Here's the weirdest and for me one of the loveliest parts of Mechanicus the turn based combat has very little RNG going on. It's more like a game of chess on a procedurally generated map where your meat shield troops are your pawns and your Tech Priests are your back row. A universal pool of points exists which you harvest and deploy as you see fit between your troops as the turn progresses. You can choose to burn the lot on one hero priest who goes on a solo killing spree or spread them evenly amongst your cohort as you proceed the choice is entirely yours. The nuances here are surprisingly subtle and as the system doesn't correspond to many (if any) other games I am finding the process of discovering what I am capable of to be very rewarding. A successful mission awards you new kit and a substance called blackstone which you spend on your Priests to open up the various skill trees. Sculpting a Priests build by working out what skills dovetail with what items is proving pleasingly complex.Of final note is probably my favourite aspect of the game the awakening of the Necron planet and the triggering of the final boss fight is hard capped. Each mission will advance the awakening a minimum of 3% but poor choices and bad luck can easily make it double that so you are permanently searching for the sweet spot on an invisible bell curve where you get the most experience and loot for your troops whilst minimising how much you awaken the planet in the process.It is commonly held that the challenge drops off as you get further into the campaign and I have to say that in spite of a recent patch that apparently addressed this issue this still appears to be true to a certain extent. However. I am still finding the originality of the ideas their excellent implementation and the overall quality of the product continues to outweigh any levelling out of the difficulty curve. To this end I would recommend figuring the game out from first principals and steering away from any guides that tell you much more than I've done here Mechanicus really is at it's best when you're trying to make sense of it.8/10 Would happily aspire to transcend this crude biomass again!,"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"

Back in the day I would paint up metal Vostroyan figures in Mars colors and call them Skitarii. I got into Forge World's Horus Heresy just so I could play a Mechanicum army. When they finally got a proper 40k release I immediately dropped several hundred bucks on building a War Convocation which I later bolstered with a Warhound Titan for my group's Apocalypse games. I regret nothing. I love the Adeptus Mechanicus.I also love isometric tactical games and man this game is like a dream come true. Think Jagged Alliance 2 with cyborgs. If you don't think that sounds awesome you need the lameness and suckitude centers of your weak fleshy brain excised. Unfortunately ever since THQ went down (RIP) 40k games have had a pretty sharp drop off in quality so naturally I was a bit wary. I mean hell even the latest Dawn of War wasn't all that great. Worry not. This one is a solid entry.It is the year 40 000. Everything sucks. You play as Magos Dominus Faustinius of the Adeptus Mechanicus a group of fanatically religious Martian transhuman cyborgs who extoll the weaknesses of flesh and probably listen to way too much Mega Drive. You are waging a campaign against the Necrons billion year old super future Egyptian robot aliens that want to literally kill all organic life in the galaxy (and could probably pull it off too). They probably also listen to too much Mega Drive but most likely believe that 198XAD was a better album than Hardwired so that's reason enough for these two factions to go to war.Along the way you do the typical Squad Based Game song and dance. You wage a world map campaign manage the inventory and upgrades on your dudes listen to your advisors the works. Interestingly the game differs from XCOM in that it's more about the mission than your squad. Life is cheap in the 41st millenium and this game nails that feeling. Rather than cautiously inch forward with your veterans you are encouraged to throw cannon fodder ""troops"" at your enemies which will be replenished once the mission ends. And the missions themselves are damn solid affairs. The Cognition mechanic allows your Tech Priests (read heroes) to use more powerful equipment and increase their action economy by harvesting knowledge from objectives and slain enemies. This keeps the turn based combat feeling surprisingly fast paced and it's a refreshing departure from the XCOM gold standard of alternating activations and double actions.All in all damn solid game and worth a playthrough or two. I would highly recommend it if you're a 40k fan. Otherwise worth grabbing the next time you catch it on sale.","Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"

The aesthetics are truly wonderful and the sound design is unforgettable. It is well paced not over simplified yet not too caught up in tactical micromanagement. The basic gameplay loop is expansive and interesting.Bugs are very exceptional the controls are crisp and responsive.When you juice up your tech priests the game can get a bit easy but it is still fun. Actually it is so much fun that time flew by and I finished it in two long sessions. Still loved every second of it every weird and alien sound every new upgrade and every instance of shooting a damn necron back into wherever their ugly xenos face got spit out from.This game is a gem. It is evidently crafted with lots of love and care and lots of thought came into this unique and nightmarishly beautiful depiction of 40k. The basic conflict between necrons and the adeptus mechanicus is interesting as well and it makes you think about the similarities between them as well as about the whole relationship between mankind and machines.What is left to say? BUY IT AT FULL PRICE! TELL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT IT! SUPPORT IT! This game deserves our praise and support. And now go kill some undead robots!PRAISE THE MACHINE GOD!,"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"

434885,2018-11-15,2,110,44,False,Recommended,"Mechanicus is a game that shares a few similarities with XCOM. However has a lot of unique mechanics that make it very much its own game. Video Reviewhttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v PQWgBoWvSbk Written Review Set in the 40K universe you play as a squad of Tech Priests trying to keep Necrons at bay while exploring their crypts. As someone who has never delved into the 40K universe this has been the first time I have been so excited to experience it as the lore behind these guys is very interesting. The game's characters are all very unique and have distinct personalities. They disagree on a lot of things and these conflicts are well written as well as the descriptions of rooms which create a strong and vivid atmosphere. The music and sounds that accompanies all this really helps drive a tense and immersive world. As for the gameplay once you enter a crypt you are given the choice which rooms you want to enter and in doing so will be met with random encounters that you must deal with. For example you might find a wounded enemy. You might be able to finish it off capture it for research or just leave it be. Depending on what you choose you will get a different outcome. You might earn material rewards take damage alert the enemies to your presence etc. Different characters will comment or react differently depending on their interests which makes your choices that much more compelling As you progress through the crypt the ""awake"" meter will increase which means you do not want to linger too long and fully explore. As the meter rises enemies will be buffed making the mission a lot harder. Once you've completed the mission that ""awake"" meter will carry over onto a global ""awake"" meter similarly to the ""Avatar Project"" in Xcom 2. This forces you to be very careful about the choices you make and to try tread quickly which I really enjoy but I can see it being a negative for some people. Once you encounter enemies you will be placed into a battle mode. It is NOT like Xcom where you as the player control all units at once and then the enemy has their turn. Instead each unit has its own turn that you can see on the timeline. Each unit has a set number of tiles it can travel. As an example if your unit has the ability to walk 10 tiles away if you only walk one tile and then shoot you will then still be allowed to walk the rest of your 9 tiles if you choose to. Also you are allowed to use multiple actions at once including multiple guns melee healing etc provided you have the CP for it. CP stands for Cognition points which is a currency you use in battle. You can use this to walk further than your usual walking distance. It is also needed to attack with certain weapons. You gain CP by absorbing it from enemies and pillars throughout the battle. Once a whole battle round has ended (meaning everyone has played their turn) all pillars will refill their CP allowing you to gather more. Gameplay revolving CP can be really in depth because it's all about spending it correctly. You could in theory traverse the entire battlefield as long as you keep absorbing CP on your way there. You can also send your companion servo skulls over to distant pillars in order to absorb some CP for you. Cover is not used in the game like in Xcom. Yes you can break line of sight by standing behind a wall. but your characters do not actually take cover nor are there bonuses for full/half cover. Instead you send expendable units known as troops. One example of a troop is called ""Servitor'. Which is a throwaway unit that is meant to be cannon fodder to protect your more valuable Tech Priests. They can only melee don't have much health and can't walk far but will attract enemy fire and once hit will actually give you CP. Under the explanation that the Tech Priests are ""studying the enemy weaponry as they attack the Servitors"". It's a really interesting mechanic that also builds upon the lore. There are a few other mechanics during battle that make it interesting like resistances to certain weapon types or one time use spells as well as charging weaponry after usage but I don't want to oversaturate the review. I've explained the core mechanics. To summarise the combat feels very original to me and is quite enjoyable. Once you're done with a mission you will earn rewards. You then have the choice of what mission to undertake next as well as what units to take with you. In your ship between missions you can also customize your units. You have the choice to rename and colour them whatever you want which is a welcome option. You will then use any blackstone you've acquired in order to upgrade your units. You can choose perks from multiple trees that focus on different things. Upon doing that the next upgrade will cost more and you will earn an augmentation slot. With this slot you can now equip a new weapon/armor or whatever you desire to the unit. This allows you to have multiple weapons and gadgets which makes your character look like a badass.Overall I'm really loving the game. The soundtrack is so cool and really compliments the atmosphere created by the well written descriptions and characters. Gameplay is original and gratifying and upgrading your characters feels satisfying. I'm very happy to finally be introduced to the 40k universe through a side of it I find incredibly interesting. I highly recommend the game!","Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"
434886,2018-11-17,1,37,10,False,Recommended,YOUR FLESH WILL ROT AND DECAY.STEEL IS IMMORTAL.FOR THE OMNISSIAH.This is a really good somewhat xcom inspired Strategy game.The mission structure of the game is pretty neat you basically play the game against a countdown and once the countdown is over the necron pharaoh awakens.So what do you do to prevent the countdown from ticking down? Nothing!Because the goal isn't to finish the game before the countdown runs out (although this is possible as i achieved it on my first playthrough).The goal is to gain as many ressources and upgrades as you can while the countdown is running respectively to weaken the bossboss by taking out the other 5 bosses that will come to aid him if they're still alive.The combat is fairly basic as in if you've ever played a turn based strategy game you will feel right at home however it is pretty fun as the game contains a lot of different equipment enemy types and such although i'd have to lie if i were to say that there isn't some degree of repetition involved.The game takes some cues from the xcom formular as your core troop consists of 2 (upgradable to 6) Tech Priests each with 12 equipment slots and 6 little skillstrees.Unlike XCOM there is no permadeath involved as WE HAVE CASTED AWAY OUR WEAK VESSELS OF FLESH and instead dead priests will simply be repaired after a mission although at a fairly high cost.The game expands on this formular by additionally giving you access to different stormtroopers who are meant to be disposable and cost a little bit of ressources to use.All in all the core gameplay loop of EXTERMINATING THE XENOS HERESY is really fun and enjoyable the biggest issue this game has is that the game only has one difficulty and is designed around the idea that you occasionally will fail a mission however if you don't you eventually start snowballing really hard because your own troops become stronger at a much faster rate than your opponent.Nonetheeless i'd definitley recommend checking this one out.,"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"
434887,2018-11-17,3,41,38,False,Recommended,"Domini and Dominae I believe what we are dealing with here is a jewel. That very rare and elusive beast of a game that comes every once in a blue moon cycle (Terran standard) to give an exceptional example of what a Warhammer 40k tale should be.It is incredibly loyal to the fluff not only by the binaric lines of the protagonists but by the very mechanics in the game that will make you catch yourself thinking like a Magos of the hallowed Mechanicum in exactly (t 32*y &lt 2300/# x (alpha.phi)) minutes into the game.A race against time both in the campaign segment and in every Mission and battle you will be driven ever onwards in your Quest for Knowledge to both uncover the relics of mankinds past and beat the clock ticking away the days to the full awakening of the Necrons.Standing on the shoulders of Giants the developers used 20+ years of fleshing out the Cult in the lore to bring you every possible facet a Magos may adopt represented in the cast that advise and guide you on your journey the Grounded no nonsense one the ambitions borderline Heretek one the Conservatic dogma spouting one and others (""lets just pray harder at it!"") who all speak via the lingua technis immersing me in the fantasy that I'm but a Techpriest on mission from Mars. Contrast that to the filthy awakening Xenos who are voiced in perfect English.Making the first boss encounter basically ""Beep boo boop beep?""""Pzzt baaa bee beep boo 1101 0101 1101 1000""""What the hell are you doing in my house? Get the hell outta here Imma kick your """"Beep boop!""Joy.It's turn based giving you plenty of time to ponder your next step into damnation team based so you *have* to coordinate both your highly customizable Tech priests and your Cohorts of sorry subDomina Disposable troops but unlike X Com it removes an element of chance where your 95% hit chance misses for the 3rd time in a row. Well damage still comes in ranges and unless you scan it you have no idea how much more the enemy can take or his armor. Foes have advanced reanimation protocols so that's cool that you've killed it but now you have to stomp it while it's down or else it's coming back!To give you an edge while losing you may be choosing one of the many Canticles of the Omnissiah a single use per mission buff that when played correctly gives you that needed armor shredding or extra movement to finish the mission this turn and avoid disaster in the next.I cannot reccomend this enough Mechanicus is a legend in the making and you should NOT be missing out.I'm definetly hooked.","Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"
434888,2018-11-20,0,0,36,False,Recommended,First off if you like X Com style of games you will most likely like this game. If you like Warhammer 40k then this game will also appeal to you. This is one of the best Warhammer 40k games I have ever played and the unit management upgrades combat is fantastic.One thing to note the campaign is relatively short and I beat it in 17 hours unlocking 17/22 achievements in my first play through. The game is relatively easy if you are used to X Com style games even the hardest settings are easy and I was able to kill the final 3 bosses in just 3 rounds in the game with the final boss with 1 character in 1 round. Still recommend the game just immersive fun just not long enough. I would love to see Expansion packs in the future.,"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"
434889,2018-11-18,1,44,12,False,Recommended,As a disclaimer I'm an AdMech player on the tabletop so this review is going to be completely biased. A lot of games come out in the 40k universe and there are very few that are actually worth the price. By the grace of the Omnissiah 40k Mechanicus is one of those games that every 40k fan out there should support. Its not without its issues notably the game gets too easy once your tech priests are half way equiped and you can field proper Skitarii troops also the Necron AI at times is less than intelligent.There also doesn't seem to be any method of reducing the Awakeness gauge or an endless mode so once you beat the main game its pretty much over (I'd advise keeping a backup of your save just incase DLC or something gets added).All that being said Mechanicus is still a lot of fun. At its core its a rather simple but addictive turn based tactics game. I consider it sort of XCOM lite. Cover is pretty much just line of sight (which lets you cheese pretty bad) and the maps aren't very big but they get the job done. Once you start understanding what each troop unit can do what combos of tech priest upgrades and equipment work well together you'll be blasting through the Necron tombs with ease. Ultimately what sold me was the ability to play as the AdMech. I'm so used to the Space Marines taking center stage with everything that its so refreshing to see a 40k game that does not have an ultra smurf running around. Bottom line is that if you like tactics games (think XCOM) you like 40k and you want a game you can just sit down and enjoy Mechanicus is totally for you. If not still buy it cause I want more AdMech stuff and this is great advertisment. Now if only I could convince the devs and GW to release a Kill Team or Necromunda game...EDITED Cause I cannot English.,"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"
434890,2019-01-21,1,28,20,False,Recommended,Don't listen to people who claim it's the game only for Adeptus Mechanicus lore fans I had zero knowledge about AdMech (coming from that minority who prefers Warhammer Fantasy Battles to 40k) and I'm really enjoying it. It's fun has soul and spirit is not overcomplicated or frustrating.+ Great atmosphere (especially banter and disputes between characters who give missions and track the progress of your squad during missions)+ Solid tactical game with some good ideas+ Good customization options for your TechPriests+ The story is interesting enough the dialogues are fun+ Nice OST really helps to immerse Only one enemy faction (Necrons). But it's the matter of Games Workshop licence and not really developer's fault. Besides Necrons are the most fitting xenos enemy for AdMech lorewise. Once you level up and customize your TechPriests well enough the game becomes much easier. It's still fun for me but might not please those who want more challenge. Level mission maps seem to be scripted and static not randomly created (I might be wrong though),"Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus"
